India is home to 8% of the world’s biodiversity, including 70% of the world’s tiger population, Union Minister Prakash Javadekar said while releasing a report about the status of, ahead of Global Tigers Day.""In 1973, there were just nine tiger reserves which have now increased to 50. It is important to know that none of these reserves are of poor quality. Either they are good or the best,” Union Minister Prakash Javadekar said.He added, “Despite India's constraint of 2.5% of global land, 4% of rainfall and 16 % of world's human population, India is home to 8% of world's biodiversity, which includes 70% of the world's tiger population.”Currently, the tiger population within the reserves is 1,923 (65 percent of the total tiger population of India), the report said.The 'Status of Tigers, Co-predators and Prey in India report for 2018' showed that out of the 50 tiger reserves in the country, three reserves - Mizoram's Dampa reserve, West Bengal's Buxa reserve and Jharkhand's Palamau reserve - have no tigers left.According to the population estimation of tigers in reserves for 2018-19, Corbett has 231 tigers, followed by Nagarhole and Bandipore reserves in Karnataka with 127 and 126 tigers respectively, reported PTI.According to Javadekar, India is ready to take a leadership role and work with all tiger range countries for the management of the reserves and the conservation of the big cat.There are currently 13 tiger range countries — India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Russia, Thailand and Vietnam.According to the report, in the state-wise distribution of tigers, Madhya Pradesh was found with maximum tigers at 526 followed by Karnataka at 524 and 442 in Uttarakhand.Last year Prime Minister Narendra Modi had released the four-yearly tiger census report according to which the tiger population in the country had grown from 1,400 in 2014 to 2,967 in 2019.(With inputs from PTI)SEE ALSO:",https://www.businessinsider.in/science/environment/news/indias-tiger-population-has-nearly-doubled-in-12-years/articleshow/77220681.cms,2439

"Sikhs prepare over 30,000 free meal packets for Americans in self-isolation","USA: Sikhs prepare over 30,000 free meal packets for Americans in self-isolation",1.0,"By Reena Bhardwaj

New York [USA], Mar 24 (ANI): The Sikh Center of New York prepared and packaged more than 30,000 home-cooked meals for Americans in coronavirus self-isolation.

The Sikh community was approached by New York's Mayor office for food packages that were handed out to several distributing federal agencies in the area. Monday morning onwards the agencies will further distribute and deliver free food to COVID-19 affected people in New York City, one of the worst affected cities in the US by coronavirus.

Strict food hygiene practices were observed while the food was prepared such as maintaining social distancing and using face masks and gloves.

Himat Singh, coordinator of American Gurudwara Prabhandak Committee (east coast) told ANI: ""The 'Sewa' or service provided by the Sikh volunteers is a vegetarian meal comprising of dry fruits, rice and lentils.""

""The meals were prepared on Sunday and was packaged and loaded for delivery. The distribution starts on Monday in the morning, by local authorities. Volunteers who prepared and packaged the meal had a medical check and have been approved by physicians and health authorities,"" Singh added.

The distributing agencies will provide the food packages to the elderly or people having trouble getting food at the supermarket, specially-abled, homeless and single parents who are looking after their kids and can't go out, he further added.



Food items that have been previously donated to the Gurudwara are being used for this initiative and even the Gurudwara funds are being used. United Sikhs, an NGO based across the United States, also made an appeal to people from all walks of life to donate generously.

99 per cent of the people using the meals are Americans, the only Indians are those coming from overseas or students who are isolating for 14 days.

Several Sikh volunteers from the East, West Coast and the Mid West of the United States are ready with an infrastructure to help agencies across the country. They are geared with free food, shelter at Gurudwara's and even delivering essentials and medicines for the homeless and needy.

""Once we heard people were having a problem with food when they go shopping, they can't find food in the shopping centre, then we started reaching out to people in our personal capacity in the Bay Area(San Francisco),"" Dr Pritpal Singh, coordinator of the American Gurudwara Prabhandak Committee (west coast) told ANI.

He also said that they have seen firsthand it was mostly the elderly who needed their service and it's mostly vulnerable people who are worried about the virus.

The Sikh volunteers applauded the efforts of the federal agencies who have been working round the clock to combat the crisis and also appealed to follow the advisories sent out by the city, state and federal agencies.

Jathedar Harpreet Singh, Sri Akal Takht Sahib and the spiritual leader of the Sikh community told ANI that he appeals to the Sikh community and there is a need to spring into action as the pandemic crisis deepened in the world in the past few weeks.

""We have requested gurudwaras across the country and the world to especially reach out to the stranded Indian students and provide them meals and shelter, which will give relief to many worried parents back in India,"" Jathedar Harpreet Singh said. (ANI)

"Kenyan Woman Saves 15,000 Young Girls From Female Genital Mutilation • EBONY","Kenyan Woman Saves 15,000 Young Girls From Female Genital Mutilation",1.0,"Nice Nailantei Leng’ete was recently named one of Time’s Most Influential People, and for good reason. The 27-year-old Kenyan has made it her life’s work to help young African girls escape “female cutting,” commonly referred to as female genital mutilation (FGM). While discussing her mission with Yahoo Lifestyle, Leng’ete explained the cause is close to her heart because she escaped the archaic practice herself at 8 years old.

“I escaped by running away,” Leng’ete shared, saying she and her sister hid in a tree until the ceremony was over. And she has now helped over 15,000 others avoid FGM as well.

Leng’ete is also working to rid Africa of child marriage and FGM by 2030, introducing alternative rites of passage to her male-dominated Maasai community.

“FGM, for Maasai, is a rite of passage from girlhood to womanhood. Women are not considered women unless they have gone through FGM,” Leng’ete said, explaining the societal role of female circumcisions. “FGM in my community connects to girls ending their education, with child marriage, and with teenage pregnancies. A girl is 10 or 12 years old when she undergoes FGM. Then she’s told she’s a woman, and that means she’s ready for marriage, and that means she has children. They all go together.”

Leng’ete knew she was destined for more while witnessing the ritual as a child.

“I saw pain. I saw death. Since I was 7 years old, I used to attend these ceremonies in my community with girls undergoing FGM. I saw my friends leave school and get married. And I wanted to continue my education.”

That’s just what she did, becoming the first girl in her village to go to high school. Her school uniform inspired other girls in her community, who later sought her help to avoid “the cut.” While she initially hid those seeking help, this made her a wanted woman in the region, leading her to take a different approach.

The young hero, instead, received permission to share information about sexual health and wellness with her village. After four long years of educating her community, the elders were convinced that Maasai would be more prosperous if women were able to stay in school longer, marry later and forego female circumcisions. Elders officially renounced the practice of FGM in 2014.

“I’m driven by passion,” Leng’ete said. “Being able to protect these younger girls from these harmful practices is what I want to do; it’s an important job. When I see the girls in school, that’s my happiness. I’m hoping to reach many more — every girl — if I’m able.”",https://www.ebony.com/news-views/kenyan-woman-saves-15000-young-girls-from-female-genital-mutilation,2529
"Wisbech mum thanks ‘little angel’ Daniel who set up a JustGiving page to buy her son a replacement bike - more than £1,400 has now been raised","A 13 year old child who had his bike violently stolen, ribs broken, and was left by the side of the road has had over £1000 raised by Redditors to replace the one he had saved over 8 months to buy.",1.0,"Published: 10:39 AM February 2, 2017 Updated: 6:22 AM November 4, 2020

The JustGiving page has now raised £1,413 - more than double its original target. - Credit: Archant

A Wisbech mum whose 13-year-old son was attacked and robbed of his Suzuki motorbike is thanking the “little angel” who set up a fundraising page which has raised £1,413 in a week to buy him a replacement.

Daniel Sobey-Harker launched a JustGiving page last Wednesday (25) after he read that the victim, who had saved for eight months to buy a £600 Suzuki, was kicked, punched, ran over and robbed – just three days after buying the bike.

The victim’s mum said: “I’ve been speechless.

“How one person that’s not related to any members of our family could put so much effort in for a child, who is really a stranger, is just amazing.

“We never thought about raising any finances because I was more concentrating on supporting my son.

You may also want to watch:

“You don’t really get many people around here doing things like this.

“Daniel is just a little angel. I think he’s doing it just because he’s a good, kind person. He’s gone beyond any expectations.”

Daniel, who lives in London, will travel to Wisbech to meet the boy and his mum in the next few weeks and buy him a new bike.

He is also going to take the boy shopping so that he can buy safety items with the remaining money.

“Seeing my son having hope and making him feel happier in this difficult time is just lovely,” the victim’s mum added.

“Although he still doesn’t feel comfortable being around people and is a little insecure. It could take a bit of time, but Daniel’s just given him a huge surprise.

Daniel, who set up the page with a target of £601, said: “It’s quite heart-warming how many people have come together to donate money.

“Because there’s a good amount of money left over, I’m going to go shopping with him to get him some safety bits.

“It’s something that shouldn’t happen to anyone, but for each of the two attackers there’s been 20 or more people wanting to help. He seems like a good kid.

“As a motorcyclist myself I know the joys of going for a ride and while it can be dangerous, the only risks he should face are ones faced on a trail.”

The attack happened near the Thomas Clarkson Academy (TCA) on Corporation Road at 4.45pm on Sunday (22).

Detectives are hunting the assailants, thought to be two men aged between 20 and 25.

The mother said her son had saved pocket money to buy the off road bike. She said he went out of the house and pushed the bike around Railway Road, Queens Road and Weasenham Lane before the attack happened.

She said when they were near the TCA two men started to walk towards her son.

When her son was found on the pavement “he was still conscious but panicking, crying, screaming and bleeding from the mouth”, she added.

He was treated at hospital but allowed home: his mother said he would return to school later in the week.

A police spokesman said: “If you were in that area at approximately 16:45hrs on Sunday January 22, or have seen a bike matching that description please call 101 in confidence and quote CF0037860117, or call crime stoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.”",http://www.cambstimes.co.uk/news/wisbech_mum_thanks_little_angel_daniel_who_set_up_a_justgiving_page_to_buy_her_son_a_replacement_bike_1_4866433,3212

Women in a village near the Wildlife SOS Elephant Conservation and Care Centre in the northern city of Mathura reportedly began producing the colourful, pyjama-like garments after staff at the centre warned temperatures were approaching sub-zero at night.

The conservation centre takes in rescued elephants who have previously suffered chronic neglect and beatings from cruel handlers.

Teen Activists — The sisters who convinced Bali to ban plastic bags,Have you heard about the plastic bag ban in Bali? But did you know it's partly because of two teen sisters who have been campaigning for years to rid their island of plastic,1.0,"India’s crisis: a case study

Among the developing countries, India has stood out during the crisis. Due to its vast number of vaccine companies, and long history of successful inoculation drives, the country was expected to curb the pandemic—and it appeared to be weathering the crisis well compared to other nations. Unfortunately, that changed quickly. Attempts made by the government to push certain vaccines backfired, as safety concerns grew, reducing public trust. As a result, parts of the population refused to be vaccinated, decreasing its general effectiveness. Adding to this, India suffered distribution issues.

India’s transmission rate is now considered a global threat. At the time of writing, it accounts for about one in three of all new cases, including some of the first mutations of the virus. The monumental surge in cases is not being followed by proper inoculation. According to Our World in Data, a little over 10% of the population has had at least one dose and only about 3% is fully vaccinated.

Much of the population are enduring the worst of conditions, without proper access to medical health, food, or even shelter. According to the census of 2011, about 1.77 million people are homeless in India, and among the chaos, are left neglected. The effects of this pandemic have been felt deeply by everyone, everywhere, but this is especially true for those living in the fringes of society.

The media gives us insights into the dire situation India finds itself in. Volunteering or donating is one way to help them overcome this dark moment in history—one that many of us will have experienced first hand. The other is through cross-governmental support. Only then can we give India the resources it needs to bounce back.",https://www.kinder-world.org/articles/solutions/teen-activists-the-sisters-who-convinced-bali-to-ban-plastic-bags-18983,1752
"More than a million people in the UK have quit smoking since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, new study shows","More than a million people in the UK have quit smoking since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, new study shows",1.0,"More than one million people in the UK have given up smoking since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, according to a new study by the nonprofit Action on Smoking and Health.

Almost half (41%) said it was a direct response to heightened health concerns during the coronavirus pandemic.

The study also found that older people are quitting at slower rates than younger people, despite being categorized in the more vulnerable group.

""I don't want to be one of those people in a ward with an oxygen mask over my face struggling to tell my loved ones what I'm feeling,"" one recent quitter told Business Insider.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Before the coronavirus pandemic hit, Saurav Dutt smoked up to six cigarettes a day.

The 38-year-old author from London first took up the habit as a way to unwind from college exams. But as the years went by he found that it helped him focus, and it became essential to his writing process.

""Smoking inspires my writing ... and drives me out of dark moods when I hit writer blocks or doubt my efforts,"" Dutt told Business Insider.

But as COVID-19 gripped the world, Dutt — who had tried quitting in the past, but never managed to do so — decided it was finally time to give up.

So, after 18 years of smoking, he quit.

""I don't want to be one of those people in a ward with an oxygen mask over my face struggling to tell my loved ones what I'm feeling,"" Dutt said. ""COVID-19 has brought the issue of personal health into focus for me like never before.""

He is not alone. According to a recent survey by the UK charity Action on Smoking and Health (ASH), conducted between April 15 to June 20, more than one million people in Britain have given up smoking.

Of those poeple, almost half (41%) said it was a direct response to heightened health concerns during the coronavirus pandemic, the study added. COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, has so far killed more than 700,000 people worldwide.

Their reaction is understandable: COVID-19 is known to attack the respiratory system first, with symptoms including a bad cough and shortness of breath.

Smokers may have higher risk of getting severe coronavirus symptoms

In the last few months, researchers have been trying to find out how strong the link between smokers and severe coronavirus cases really is.

A recent study by The Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco found that smokers are nearly twice as likely to develop severe coronavirus symptoms.

The research examined more than 11,000 COVID-19 patients and found that about 30% of those who had a history of smoking saw their conditions progress to a more severe or critical state.

Another study published last month by researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, found that one in three young adults between the ages of 18 and 25 are at higher risk of having severe COVID-19 cases, with smoking habits playing a big part.

Patients are considered vulnerable if they have at least one risk factor set out by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), including health conditions and smoking habits.

More young people are giving up smoking

Younger smokers appear to be giving up smoking at a much higher rate than their older counterparts.

The study by ASH found that of the 1 million people who quit between April and June, 400,000 were aged between 16 and 25.

""For young people who have been quitting, there's a desire to generally be more healthy, and take control at a time in their lives where that control has been taken away,"" Hazel Cheeseman, the policy dierctor for ASH told Business Insider.

""Younger people are more likely to be in employment that's been disrupted, or have their education or social lives disrupted. Their lives have been much more affected by the experience of lockdown, whereas older people have been in their own homes and maintained their own space.""

Cheeseman said that ASH's findings have been ""surprising"" considering it is older people who are more at risk of contracting the coronavirus.

""Older smokers have been smoking longer because most people start in their teens. They're therefore more likely to be more heavily addicted and therefore quitting is more difficult for them,"" she said.

""But they are also more insulated from some of the factors that have motivated people to quit right now.""

While the survey results showed a sign of short-term success for smokers giving up, it remains to be seen if this translates into a continued pattern.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has also warned that the disease poses particular risks to smokers.

At a press briefing in July, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: ""Smoking kills 8 million people a year, but if users need more motivation to kick the habit, the pandemic provides the right incentive.""

That incentive has worked for Dutt. He said that while it hasn't been easy, he knows that it's for the better.

""Quitting has been incredibly difficult but nearing 40, the reality of looking after one's health is more important than ever, and I am no longer willing to allow a drug to rule my life,"" Dutt said.",https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-smokers-quit-record-numbers-study-2020-8,5161
Walmart cashier steps in when nail salon refuses wheelchair-bound woman,Walmart cashier steps in when nail salon refuses wheelchair-bound woman,1.0,"(8/3/2018) - A simple act of kindness is making a big impact.

When a Walmart cashier in Burton saw a customer get turned away from the store's nail salon, she took matters into her own hands

""I was like making sandwiches and I was watching her like,"" Tasia Smith said of the scene Thursday that brought her to tears.

She works at the Subway inside the Burton Walmart on Court Street.

That's where she captured a photo, which has since gone viral, of Walmart cashier Ebony Harris skipping her break to paint customer Angela Peters' nails.

""I just wanted to post it for awareness and appreciation, because people needed to know what was going on with the business and Ebony deserved all the appreciation she could get,"" Tasia said.

Harris said she watched the nail salon, located just a few feet over, refuse to do Peters' nails because her hands shake quite a bit due to cerebral palsy. So, she decided to do something about it.

""I just wanted to make her day special. I didn't really want her day to be ruined. That's why I did it. And plus she's a sweetie,"" Harris said.

Together, the two picked out some polish and relaxed in the seating area at Subway for a manicure.

""And you know, she moved her hands a little bit and she kept saying she was sorry. And, I told her don't say that. I said you're fine,"" Harris said.

It was a simple act of patience and kindness that's still making Angela smile.

""I thought that was so nice of her and I already felt comfortable with her because, like I said, I shop at Walmart a lot,"" Peters said.

Harris has no qualms with the nail salon, but she hopes her actions inspire others to treat people with disabilities the way they would want to be treated themselves.

""We're not trying to bash the nail salon. We're not trying to make them lose customers, make them look bad,"" she said. ""But maybe spread awareness that no matter the person, who they are, what color they are, disability, whatever, they're people too. She's a girly girl. She's just like you, me, Tasia, my daughter, anybody. She wants to look pretty, you know, and so why can't she?""

Sitting next to her new friend at her store inside Collette's Vintage and Antique Mall, Peters said she's grateful not only for Harris' help, but a beautiful manicure too.

""I'm like wow. These are amazing!"" she said.

""I told her she's a blessing to us, to anybody, not just me. She makes me look at life and appreciate it much more than, you know, what I have been,"" Harris added.

The three plan to continue their friendship, already scheduling a dinner at Peters' favorite restaurant in town.

To check out Angela's business, stop by Collette's Vintage and Antique Mall on Wednesday through Friday or the Davison Farmer's Market on Saturdays.

Incredibly accurate atomic clocks may detect faint signals from dark matter,Incredibly accurate atomic clocks may detect faint signals from dark matter,1.0,"Incredibly accurate atomic clocks may detect faint signals from dark matter

Atomic clocks are nothing new, these timepieces have been around for many years. Scientists working on experimental atomic clocks at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) have reported three new performance records for their clocks. The team says that the clocks have improved accuracy enough that not only are they going to improve timekeeping and navigation, but they may be sensitive enough to detect faint signals from gravity, the early universe, and dark matter.

Each of the new atomic clocks traps a thousand ytterbium atoms in grids that are made of laser beams. The atoms tick by switching between two energy levels. The researchers can compare the two independent clocks allowing them to improve systematic uncertainty, stability, and reproducibility.

Systematic uncertainty is how well the clock can represent the natural vibrations of the atoms captured in the laser lattice. The team found the clock had a possible error of one billionth of a billionth from the natural ticking frequency of the atoms. Stability is how much the clock frequency changes over time, in this case, it changes 0.00000000000000000032 during a day. Reproducibility is how close the two clocks tick at the same frequency, the frequency difference was less than one billionth of a billionth in this test.

The ytterbium atomic clocks exceed the conventional capability to measure the shape of the Earth (geodetic measurement) based on tidal gauge surveys of sea level. Researchers say that a comparison of these clocks located far apart, on different continents, could provide geodetic measurements within 1 centimeter, better than the current several centimeters.

Some of the improvements to the new clock include thermal and electric shielding that surrounds atoms to protect them from stray electric fields. Ytterbium atoms are one of the potential candidates to be used in the future redefinition of the second. Scientists are currently redefining all sorts of measurements, including a recent redefinition of how to describe a kilogram.",https://www.slashgear.com/incredibly-accurate-atomic-clocks-may-detect-faint-signals-from-dark-matter-29556306/,2128
Birmingham college student walked 20 miles to 1st day of work so his boss gave him his car,Alabama college student walked 20 miles to 1st day of work so his boss gave him his car,1.0,"When a young Birmingham college student's car broke down the night before he was supposed to start a new job, he didn't panic. At least not for long.

Instead, Walter Carr walked. From Homewood to Pelham. All night. In the dark. 20 miles or more.

A Carver High School graduate and U.S. Marine hopeful, Carr walked throughout the early morning hours Friday because he needed, and wanted, the job with Bellhops moving company. He made it to Hoover by 2 a.m. and then to Pelham at 4 a.m.

It was in Pelham that the trek took a surprising turn. Kindness and concern from four Pelham police officers coupled with publicly-posted words of amazement and admiration from the moving company's clients about Carr's work ethic and dedication, led to a massive pat on the back Monday from Bellhops CEO Luke Marklin.

Marklin drove in from Tennessee under the guise of meeting Carr for coffee to personally thank him. That meeting ended with Marklin surprising Carr by giving Carr his own barely-driven 2014 Ford Escape.

""I am honestly blown away by him,'' Marklin said of Carr. ""Everything he did that day is exactly who we are - heart and grit. So far, he's batting 1,000.""

An emotional Carr had just one word when Marklin handed him the keys. ""Seriously?""

All the accolades over the weekend started with a post from Jenny Lamey on Facebook. She wrote that she and her husband, Chris, got up about 5:45 a.m. Friday to get everything staged and ready for the movers. About 6:30 a.m. their doorbell rang and the Lameys found Pelham police officers at their door.

""He proceeded to tell us that he had picked up 'this nice kid' in Pelham early this morning. The nice kid, Walter, said that he was supposed to help us with our move today. It was his first day on the job with this moving company (Bellhops) and he was 'training' today,"" Jenny Lamey wrote Saturday night.

The officer then told the Lameys about Carr's perseverance in getting to work.

""He WALKED ALL NIGHT to get from Homewood to Pelham. Because he needed to get to work. For those reading this that are not local, that's over 20 miles. You could tell how the officer told us this story that he had complete admiration for Walter and by my reaction he could tell I did too,'' she wrote. ""The police officer said they picked him up earlier that morning, took him to get some breakfast and once they checked his story out, brought Walter to our house.""

Jenny Lamey said Carr was welcome to stay until the rest of the Bellhops crew arrived, and even offered him the chance to go upstairs and take a nap until then. He declined and said he could go ahead and get started. So, he began alongside the Lameys until the crews got there.

""We chatted while we were working together early yesterday morning. He loved my kitchen and said that it was exactly the kind of kitchen he would want. He was from New Orleans. He and his mother lost their home in Hurricane Katrina and they came and made their home in Birmingham,'' she wrote. ""I asked him if he was tired from all that walking, and he said replied that he wasn't and that he had a 4-hour nap before he left at midnight. He said he made it (to) Hoover around 2 a.m. and then to Pelham around 4am, that's about when the officer picked him up and took him to get breakfast. He wore black Nike joggers which he commented that he intentionally wore because he knew he had to walk thru (sic) some pretty high grass on his middle-of-the-night trek,'' she wrote. ""He looked at me in the eye and smiled and I felt like I had known him much longer.""

Jenny Lamey also praised the rest of the moving crew, but it was clear Carr left an impression on her. She has set up a GoFundMe account to help him out.

""I just can't tell you how touched I was by Walter and his journey. He is humble and kind and cheerful and he had big dreams! He is hardworking and tough. I can't imagine how many times on that lonely walk down 280 in the middle of the night did he want to turn back,'' she wrote. ""How many times did he wonder if this was the best idea. How many times did he want to find a place to sit or lie down and wait til morning when he could maybe get someone to come pick him up and bring him back home. But he walked until he got here! I am in total awe of this young man!""

She said she made Carr tell his co-workers of his ordeal. ""Walter said, 'I walked.' That was it. Humble. I asked him to share a little more and when he did, the crew was in awe of him too,'' she wrote. ""I don't know that Walter would have shared if I hadn't asked him to.""

She ended her post with this: ""So yes, yesterday we moved. Yesterday was crazy. Yesterday was long and hard and hot. But...Walter.""

Pelham police officer Mark Knighten was the first to encounter Walter that morning. Because it was 3 a.m., and he was walking on the side of the roadway, Knighten stopped to ask Carr if everything was OK. Carr explained to him that he was walking to work, and why, and Knighten took action.

""He was very polite. It was 'yes sir' and 'no sir,''' Knighten said.

Knighten, along with officers Klint Rhodes and Carl Perkinson then took Carr to Whataburger, where they not only bought him breakfast but told him to get lunch to go as well.

Because it was still so early, Knighten said they took Carr to a church because that was the safest place to leave him until it was time for him to be at work.

Officer Scott Duffey was just coming on the clock and his fellow officers told them about their morning. Duffey then went in search of Carr who had already left the church to walk to his job assignment, which was almost in Chelsea.

Duffey picked him and drove him to the Lamey's house, where he knocked on the door and explained the situation.

Carr plans to graduate from Lawson State in December with an associate's degree in health sciences. He wants to join the U.S. Marines and then come back to Birmingham to get his bachelor's degree in physical therapy.

Carr said he is so thankful for all who stepped in. ""This was the first job in a long time to give me an opportunity to get hired,'' he said. ""I wanted to show them I got the dedication. I said I'm going to get to this job one way or another.''

""I want people to know this - no matter what the challenge is, you can break through the challenge. Nothing is impossible unless you make it impossible,'' he said. ""You can do anything you set your mind to. I've got God by my side. I'm really emotional right now trying to hold back the tears.""

Carr said his mother and father raised him to help others, and he plans to use his new car to do just that. ""To my parents, thank you for being there for me, for the hard work and dedication they put in to keep me on the right path,'' he said. ""And I want to thank God because without Him I wouldn't be here.""

""God blessed me to be a blessing,'' he said. ""Whatever challenges God puts in front of me I know its for a reason.""

Jenny Lamey also was emotional on Monday. She hugged Carr tightly and told him this: ""You've changed all of our lives Walter. You have no idea how many lives you've changed and inspired. You're a very special young man and you're going to do great things. You already are.""",https://www.al.com/news/birmingham/index.ssf/2018/07/former_marine_walked_20_miles.html,7184
"The billionaire who promised to pay off student loans for an entire graduating class just pledged to pay off their parents' educational loans, too","The billionaire who promised to pay off student loans for an entire graduating class just pledged to pay off their parents' educational loans, too",1.0,"The private-equity billionaire Robert F. Smith isn't just going to pay off the Morehouse class of 2019's student loans as he promised at their graduation: He's now promising to pay off their parents' education debt too.

The gift will cost Smith $34 million, the historically black college said in a press release on September 20.

Smith has a net worth of $6.08 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

In May, the private-equity billionaire Robert F. Smith announced he'd be setting up a grant to wipe out the entire Morehouse College class of 2019's student-loan debt.

Now that offer has been expanded to also cover those students' parents' education debt, according to a September 20 press release.

The gift cost Smith $34 million, the historically black college said in the press release. According to the press release, Smith will make the donation to Morehouse's new Student Success Program, which will in turn completely pay off all federal student loans borrowed by the 400 Morehouse students who graduated in May, nearly all of whom are black men, as well as loans owed by their parents and legal guardians.

""This liberation gift from Robert Smith — the first of its kind to be announced at a graduation in higher education —will be life-changing for our new Morehouse Men and their families,"" Morehouse College President David A. Thomas said in a statement. ""It is our hope that our graduates will use their newfound financial freedom to pursue their career goals, to lead and serve the community, and to remember the spirit of the gift given to them by paying it forward to support the education of future classes of Morehouse Men.""

Smith first announced the gift while speaking at the class of 2019's commencement in May.

""You great Morehouse men are bound only by the limits of your own conviction and creativity.""

Smith is the chairman and CEO of the Austin, Texas-based private-equity firm Vista Equity Partners. He has a net worth of $6.08 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

""With the Student Success Program in place, there is a model for all colleges and universities, starting with Morehouse and HBCUs, to receive gifts from alumni and other supporters that can offset the burden of student loans and give students the freedom to pursue their dreams, the capital to invest in the economic growth of their families and the time that they can give back meaningfully to strengthening their communities,"" Smith said in a statement to Business Insider.",https://www.businessinsider.com/robert-f-smith-morehouse-grads-parents-student-debt-pledge-2019-9,2845
A Movement to Transform Coal Miners Into Beekeepers Is Great News for the Planet,A Movement to Transform Coal Miners Into Beekeepers Is Great News for the Planet,1.0,"Tucked inside an old gymnasium, hundreds of wooden boxes are stacked along a far wall. The space, formerly home base for a summer camp, is now host to labs and classrooms filled with bright, freshly painted blue boxes.

But children won’t be playing here this summer. Instead, among the boxes and stainless steel vats, displaced coal miners and low-income West Virginians will learn a new trade — beekeeping. It’s part of a program run by the Appalachian Beekeeping Collective, a program for low-income West Virginians to make supplemental income through beekeeping.

While beekeeping may seem like an odd choice for former coal miners, it’s a viable and increasingly popular way for people in rural areas to make money. In West Virginia, where poverty is high and jobs are scarce, a large part of the population is struggling to make ends meet.

Coal mining once bolstered the region, but between 2005 and 2015, employment in the coal industry decreased by about 27 percent, according to research by West Virginia University. Across the nation, states like Kentucky, Wyoming and Pennsylvania have to find jobs to fill the employment gap left by the coal industry.

Enter the Appalachian Beekeeping Collective. The collective operates across 17 counties in southern West Virginia and offers classes in subjects like, Is Beekeeping Right for Me?, bee basics and advanced beekeeping. It’s a branch of the Appalachian Headwaters, a nonprofit formed to develop sustainable economic opportunities across the region.

Interested beekeepers can take Beekeeping 101, which is a five-week course where they learn the basics of beekeeping, bee biology and solutions to common problems. Once the new beekeeper has completed this course, he or she can become a partner in the collective. The partnership offers training, mentorship, equipment and bees for free or at a reduced cost.

But the startup cost to becoming a beekeeper can be a barrier of entry.

This was the case for Jason Young, a resident of White Oak, West Virginia.

Young originally started beekeeping as a hobby but quickly realized it could turn into a small business. “We had decided that we wanted to move forward,” he says. “But it was really the money that was holding us back.”

When Young discovered the Appalachian Beekeeping Collective offered training and equipment at low cost, he leapt at the opportunity.

Young and his daughter enrolled in the free Beekeeping 101 course and received 12 hives from the collective for a reduced price. From there, he formed White Oak Bee Co.

Last spring was their first harvest. It produced enough honey for his family and his honey-roasted coffee, which is White Oak Bee Co.’s signature item. This season, however, he has 14 hives ready to harvest and hopes to make a profit that he can reinvest in the business.

“Beekeeping and our relationship with the collective has really made that possible,” Young says.

The Appalachian Beekeeping Collective successfully trained 35 beekeepers this past year and plans to train another 55 this spring.

When it’s harvest time, the nonprofit will process, market and distribute the honey for its beekeepers for free. That can result in a nice chunk of change. In 2018, the market value for a pound of honey was about $7.33. A single hive can produce 20 to 100 pounds of honey a year, which means a single productive hive could earn its owner over $700 a year. With multiple hives, a beekeeper has the potential to make thousands of dollars every year.

And the bees do more than produce income for their owners. The forests provide nectar for the bees, and in turn, the bees pollinate these key natural habitats and create more plant diversity, says Parry Kietzman, an entomologist and educator at the collective.

Kietzman says she’s noticed people are more aware of the land and plants once they have bees.

“It seems to give people more of a handle on environmental concerns,” she says. “Simply because they’re worried about their bees.”

For others, like Young, it’s a chance to accomplish goals.

“What I feel most thankful for is the opportunity to take some dreams we’ve had for a really long time,” Young said. “And to really see them, kind of, come to be.”",http://nationswell.com/west-virginia-coal-alternative-beefarming/?utm_source=social&utm_medium=contentshare&utm_campaign=atlasobscura,4209
This company is making cheap condoms for Nigeria and other African countries,This company is making cheap condoms for Nigeria and other African countries,1.0,"This implies that there are about 23.8 million infected persons on the continent. This is why a popular company is introducing cheap condoms for Nigeria, South Africa, Botswana and other African countries.

Bloomberg reports that Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc's Durex is making a new condom label named Feels, which started selling in November 2018.

Manufactured in South Africa, it is priced a lot less than other products. Durex's Featherlite, for instance, goes for 39.99 Rand (N1,057) per pack while the new product is sold at 9.99 Rand (N264) per pack of three.

In an interview in Johannesburg, Chief Executive Officer Rakesh Kapoor further explained the need for Feels.

He said that the company also intends to use the new product to normalize the conversation about condom use in Africa.

""This special pack is priced for this market, with the same quality you would expect from any of our other brands,"" Kapoor said.

In a different statement, the company announced its plans to donate some money to help fight the spread of the disease in Africa.

Reckitt Benckiser said Durex, as well as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, will each donate $5 million to the Global Fund.

Global Fund is an international financing organization that aims to ""attract, leverage and invest additional resources to end the epidemics of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria to support attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals established by the United Nations.""

HIV/AIDS in Nigeria

The first two AIDS cases in Nigeria was diagnosed in 1985, according to the Saudi Journal of Biological Sciences.

It quickly spread as a total of 220,0000 new HIV infections were reported in 2014.

Now, an estimated 3, 229, 757 Nigerians are said to have HIV making the nation the second largest country with the disease after South Africa which has 6.8 million infected people.

Avert also reports that the country has one of the highest rates of new infection in sub-Saharan Africa.

80% of these new HIV infections are attributed to unprotected heterosexual sex while sex workers account for the majority of remaining HIV infections occurring in Nigeria.

Meanwhile, the federal government has vowed to end the HIV/AIDs epidemic by 2030.",https://www.pulse.ng/bi/lifestyle/company-makes-cheap-condoms-for-nigeria-other-african-nations-id9155159.html,2352
Gorilla hugging man who saved her life wins Photographer of the Year,Gorilla hugging man who saved her life wins Photographer of the Year,1.0,"The People’s Choice award in the Natural History Museum’s Wildlife Photographer of the Year competition went to this photo of a lowland gorilla and the man who saved her (Picture: Wildlife Photographer of the Year)

A tender hug between a lowland gorilla and the man who saved her life has been crowned the winner of the Wildlife Photographer of the Year People’s Choice award.

Photographer Jo-Anne McArthur took the photo in Cameroon, as the rescued gorilla – named Pikin – was being moved between animal sanctuaries.

More young people want to ditch Royal Family than keep it for first time ever

Pikin had been captured by poachers to be sold for bushmeat but luckily, charity group Ape Action Africa stepped in at the last minute.

Primate poaching, which is rife in Cameroon, sees hunters slaughter wild animals in order to sell their meat both in their country of origin and abroad.

Baby apes are often left orphaned after their mothers are killed and either die in the wild or are sold on as pets.

Pikin was being moved to a new enclosure within a safe forest sanctuary but woke up during her transfer when her sedation wore off.

Luckily, she woke up in the arms of her caretaker, Appolinaire Ndohoudou, a man she shared a particular bond with.

Like Pikin, Appolinaire was forced from his home, having fled Chad because of a civil war.

As he rebuilt his life in Cameroon, his work in protecting wild animals revived his appreciation for the natural world.

Jo-Anne captured the moment the two travelled together – which became the winning photo chosen by the public in the competition run by the Natural History Museum.

It was chosen from a shortlist of 24, selected by staff at the museum from almost 50,000 entries.

The picture will now be showcased in the Wildlife Photographer of the Year exhibition at the Museum until it closes on May 28.

The finalists

Sloth hanging out by Luciano Candisani (Picture: Wildlife Photographer of the Year)

Luciano Candisani had to climb the cecropia tree, in the protected Atlantic rainforest of southern Bahia, Brazil, to take an eye-level shot of this three-toed sloth.

Sloths like to feed on the leaves of these trees and so they are often seen high up in the canopy.

Elegant mother and calf by Ray Chin (Picture: Wildlife Photographer of the Year)

Every year from July to late October southern humpback whales migrate north from their Antarctic feeding grounds to give birth in the warm sheltered waters off Tonga.

Ray encountered this humpback mother and calf peacefully floating in the plankton-filled water around the island group of Vava’u, Tonga.

After Ray gently approached them, the giants swam a bit closer to have alook at him and he captured this shot as they turned around.

Roller rider by Lakshitha Karunarathna (Picture: Wildlife Photographer of the Year)

Lakshitha was on safari in MaasaiMara National Reserve, Kenya, when he spotted a lilac-breasted roller riding a zebra.

Normally they prefer to perch high up in the foliage, but this roller spent an hour or more riding around and enjoying the occasional insect meal.

Lakshitha waited for the surrounding zebras to form the perfect background before taking this tight crop.

Warm embrace by Debra Garside (Picture: Wildlife Photographer of the Year)

When polar bear mothers and cubs emerge from their dens in the early spring, the cubs stay close to their mothers for warmth and protection.

Once the cubs are strong and confident enough, they make the trek to the sea ice with their mother so that she can resume hunting for seals.

Debra waited six days near the den of this family, in Wapusk National Park, Manitoba, Canada, before they finally emerged.

She risked frostbite in freezing conditions to capture the shot.

This Brooklyn Landlord Just Canceled Rent for Hundreds of Tenants,"NYC landlord waiving April rent for his 200-300 tenants because of Coronavirus. “I told them just to look out for your neighbor and make sure that everyone has food on their table,"" he said. [NYT]",1.0,"It is too soon to get an accurate gauge of how many renters withheld their April rent and what the fallout would be for landlords.

But Mr. Salerno said in an interview on Thursday that he did not care about losing his rental income in April, nor did he care to calculate the amount that he would not be collecting from his 80 apartments. He said he had about 200 to 300 tenants in total.

He is likely forgoing hundreds of thousands of dollars in income by canceling April rent.

His only interest, he said, was in alleviating stress for his renters, even those who were still employed and now working from home.

“My concern is everyone’s health,” said Mr. Salerno, 59, whose rent gesture was first reported by the local news site Greenpointers.com. “I told them just to look out for your neighbor and make sure that everyone has food on their table.”

Mr. Salerno said a handful of his tenants messaged him last month saying that they could not afford rent. Three renters from Ireland packed up a few belongings and moved back home, he said.

When Mr. Gentile spotted the sign last week, he said he was surprised but not shocked. For the nearly four years Mr. Gentile has lived in the apartment, Mr. Salerno has been a model landlord.

Emergencies are fixed almost immediately, he said, such as a water leak in Mr. Gentile’s ceiling that was fixed, patched and painted within several hours.",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/nyregion/coronavirus-nyc-landlord-mario-salerno.html#click=https://t.co/fUY1AG7Y8t,1393
Man removes Nazi swastika tattoos after unlikely friendship,Former neo-Nazi removes swastika tattoos after unlikely friendship,1.0," -- Colorado resident Michael Kent recently sat down at a tattoo parlor in Colorado Springs to have his swastikas covered up.

Kent, a former neo-Nazi, credits an African-American parole officer named Tiffany Whittier with helping him to see beyond skin color and changing his views about white supremacy.

“If it wasn’t for her I would have seeped back into it,” said Kent. “I look at her as family.”

Whittier, 45, even inspired Kent, 38, to take down the Nazi flags he had hanging in his living room and replace them with smiley faces.

“I’m not here to judge him. That’s not my job to judge. My job is to be that positive person in someone’s life,” Whittier said.

Added Kent, “When you wake up and see a smiley face, you’re going to go to work and you’re going to smile.”

Kent now works full-time on a chicken farm in Colorado, where all his co-workers are Hispanic.

“Before all this, I wouldn’t work for anybody or with anybody that wasn’t white,” said Kent. “[Now] we have company parties, or they have quinceañeras, I’m the only white guy there!”

Redemption Ink, a national non-profit that offers free removals of hate-related tattoos, helped connect Kent with Fallen Heroes Tattoo in Colorado to begin the 15-hour process of covering his swastikas. The sterile environment is new to Kent who had his previous ink work done in prison.

“I’ve never, never, never been inside of a tattoo shop getting a professional tattoo,” he said.

Kent believes the painful process will help him move forward after spending years as a member of a violent skinhead group based in Arizona. As a father of two young children, Kent also hopes his children will see the world differently.

“I don’t want my kids to live the life I lived and live with hate,” said Kent. “I want my kids to know me for who I am now—a good father, a hard worker, and a good provider.”",http://abcnews.go.com/US/man-removes-nazi-swastika-tattoos-friendship/story?id=49496501&cid=social_fb_abcn,1856
"Holocaust survivor: I'm giving $1 million to help wounded American veterans, to express my thanks","Holocaust survivor: I'm giving $1 million to help wounded American veterans, to express my thanks",1.0,"At 83 years old, I am one of the few remaining Holocaust survivors – thanks to the American troops who rescued me in what seems like a lifetime ago.

Since World War II, I’ve felt a deep connection to American troops for saving my life – a feeling that resurfaces every year on Veterans Day and throughout the holiday giving season.

And so this year I’m saying “thank you” to the American soldiers of the 1940s by donating $1 million to organizations serving wounded American veterans today.

My donation to the Wounded Warrior Project and the Services for Armed Forces program of the American Red Cross is my way of giving back, thanking previous generations of warriors for helping me. I hope this inspires others to give back as well.

Even though more than 70 years have passed since my rescue, it’s not too late to give back. That’s a lesson I hope the next generation recognizes, because it’s all too easy to let procrastination give way to inaction. But action is what brings hope to those who need it.

I have met many American people who I am lucky enough to call my friends. First, Americans saved us. Then decades later, they welcomed us.

As a child, I spent most of World War II hiding from Nazi invaders in my native France, where my parents moved after fleeing the pogroms in Poland. Unfortunately, with the German invasion in 1940, we were again at risk. On July 16, 1942, the French police led a big roundup of Jews in Paris. More than 13,000 Jews were detained before being deported to Nazi death camps.

The police came to our apartment at 6 a.m. My parents managed to take me to my aunt’s home. She was married to a French soldier and was protected.

A few hours later, my mother was arrested as she and my brother were trying to get information about my father, who was hiding in a nearby grocery store. A concierge had pointed them out to the police. They ran, but my mother was not fast enough. She was detained and sent to the Auschwitz concentration camp. She perished there – probably within three weeks.

I was 7, and for the next two years I lived on borrowed time, shielded by other families on the outskirts of Paris. The same was true for my future wife, who was also a child in hiding. If the war had continued much longer, we would not have survived.

I vividly remember the arrival of the hundreds of thousands of American troops who landed in Normandy to liberate us in June 1944. They were our saviors, doling out packets of sweets to half-starved, war-weary children who had almost given up hope for freedom.

The gratitude I feel to these men is beyond words. They freed our country and they saved our lives. Without American troops, my family and I simply would not have existed. I think of that every time I look at our family photos.

Since the end of the war, life has been good to me. I’ve had a successful career as co-owner of one of Europe’s largest home appliance retailers, working alongside my brothers. I’ve also enjoyed raising my family, celebrating extended family gatherings of 20 people.

My wife and I have a deep sense of gratitude for America. So in the early 1990s, freshly retired, we bought a home in South Florida. I travel with my wife each winter from our home in Paris to the warmth of Miami Beach. We still appreciate our second home there, where we now spend almost a third of our time.

I have met many American people who I am lucky enough to call my friends. First, Americans saved us. Then decades later, they welcomed us.

But as I watched news stories this fall of hurricanes, flooding and wildfires striking America, inflicting suffering among civilians and veterans alike, I realized that I still had an important task left to complete in my life. I had not yet given back to the American soldiers who saved my life nearly three-quarters of a century ago.

That is why I want to help modern American veterans today. They pursue the tradition of the young men who landed on the shores of Normandy in June 1944 and who I will never forget. In giving this donation, I want to thank Americans with all my heart for coming to rescue us in our hour of need.

But I also want to make a public stand in support of America. I hope that my donation can trigger a movement and lead others to take action. My story shows it’s never too late to give back, especially for a cause that’s close to your heart. If it wasn’t too late for this octogenarian, it’s not too late for you.",http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/11/25/holocaust-survivor-im-giving-1-million-to-help-wounded-american-veterans-to-express-my-thanks.html,4441
Utah Husband Who Walked Miles with a 'Need Kidney 4 Wife' Sign Finds a Donor,Husband walks miles with sign to find a kidney donor for wife withe stage 5 kidney failure,1.0,"The 74-year-old man who walked miles to find his ill wife a kidney finally got his wish

The 74-year-old man who walked miles every day in a bad to find his wife a kidney finally got his wish.

Wayne Winters, of Farr West, Utah, was desperate to find a kidney for his wife of 26 years, Deanne Winters, who has stage 5 kidney failure.

Get push notifications with news, features and more.

On Sunday, Winters told KSTU that he got the call they were both waiting for after two years – there was a kidney available.

“I was just so overwhelmed,” he said of the call he received from the hospital. “I didn’t know what to think.”

Finding a donor is no small feat — there are 3,000 new patients added to the kidney donor waiting list each month, and 13 people die every day while waiting for their chance, according to the National Kidney Foundation. It’s hard to know how long someone will remain on the waiting list, but waits of three years or more are not uncommon.

Winters walked miles every day by the side of busy roads wearing a sign asking for anyone to donate a kidney to his wife for weeks. After his story went viral, hundreds contacted him.

“Between seven to 800 [calls], it filled my phone up,” he said. “I’m sitting here with this full phone.”

Despite all the offers, his wife’s kidney actually came from an organ donor who had passed away. The new kidney will give the couple more time together and new memories to add to their two decades together.

“If she can gave a good five years that would be awesome, we can have our life back,” Winters said.

Now that his wife has been given a second chance, Winters plans to continue his daily walks with his sign to help others have the same chance.

“I will spend more of my days walking with my sign to see how many I can get,” he said. “Think about it, we could start a kidney revolution and that would be so great.”",http://people.com/human-interest/husband-who-walked-miles-for-wife-finds-donor/,1940

Female members from the Saudi royal family were also on hand to take part in panel discussions, with Princess Al-Jawhara bint Fahad Al-Saud hosting a discussion on women’s roles in education.

Princess Adila bint Abdullah Al-Saud, a known advocate of women’s right to drive, women’s health awareness and women’s legal rights, held a talk about the kingdom’s heritage.

Princess Reema bint Bandar bin Sultan, the president’s undersecretary for the female section at the General Authority for Sports, spoke on the importance of sports in the lives of Saudi women.

The event saw activities for women only, but families were welcome to attend outdoor activities for the younger ones.

Mohammed Al Saif, general supervisor of the King Fahd Cultural Centre, told Arab News that Saudi Arabia wants to “celebrate the Saudi woman and her successful role, and remind people of her achievements in education, culture, medicine, literature and other areas”.

While women’s rights are a controversial topic in Saudi Arabia, Al Saif mentioned that there were no attempts to stop the event by any party.

Al Saif expressed his gratitude for the “heartwarming support and encouragement”.

Changes are already being made

The conservative nation looks set to undergo several reforms as part of Vision 2030, its post-oil economy plans.

Indeed, some changes have already been made in the field of women’s rights, with a ban on women voting or taking part in elections lifted in 2015, and in 2016 the strict religious police were stripped of their power to stop, question, pursue or arrest people.

The hope is to make the region a more modern, tourist-friendly destination by 2030, and subsequently there have been several calls from prominent figures to lift the controversial driving ban.

There have also been requests to lift strict labour laws, along with a landmark petition asking the government to do away with the male guardianship law.

The government also have plans to increase the percentage of women in the nation’s workforce from 23 per cent to 28 per cent by 2020.

Jimmy Carter back to building homes in Canada after after being treated for dehydration,Jimmy Carter back to building homes in Canada after after being treated for dehydration,1.0,"Jimmy Carter was back at a Habitat for Humanity worksite Friday, a day after the former president was hospitalized for dehydration while working with the organization to build homes for needy families in Canada.

A smiling Carter showed up in blue jeans and a work shirt to the site in the St. James neighborhood of Winnipeg, where hundreds of Habitat for Humanity volunteers joined him and his wife, Rosalynn, to build 25 homes.

Carter, 92, was discharged earlier in the morning from St. Boniface General Hospital, where he was treated “as a precaution” for dehydration, Carter spokeswoman Deanna Congileo said. He then attended a prayer service at the work site.

“He and Mrs. Carter extend their appreciation for the many well-wishes he received worldwide,” Congileo said in a statement.

Habitat for Humanity, which has had a long association with the Carters, is constructing 150 homes this year for people in need in Canada to celebrate the country’s 150th anniversary.

The Carters were in Edmonton, where Habitat for Humanity is building 75 homes, from Monday to Wednesday before coming to Winnipeg.

The former president had been working for about 90 minutes Thursday morning when he went to sit in a chair, the Winnipeg Free Press reported. He appeared to wobble, so Secret Service agents led him to his motorcade. He was treated by paramedics who took him away in an ambulance, without using lights or siren, the newspaper said.

This week’s project building houses in several Canadian communities is the 34th time the Carters have pitched in on Habitat for Humanity projects, lending a hand and their name to promote the work.

Carter was diagnosed with melanoma that spread to his brain in 2015, but announced in March of the following year that he no longer needed treatment. Carter continued to volunteer for Habitat for Humanitywhile being treated for cancer, working alongside volunteers at a home in Memphis, Tenn., in November 2015.

SoDo's Duwamish River Is Visibly Healing,"Seattle's Duwamish River is visibly healing. In 2001, it was labeled as one of the most toxic sites in America. After two decades of cleanup efforts by conservationists and community groups, wildlife is now returning and the river is the cleanest it's been in 100 years.",1.0,"Photo: Trees along the Duwamish.

Many Seattleites live in this city and hardly see the river that birthed it. Perhaps, crossing the South Park Bridge, we glimpse water beyond the railings. Otherwise the Duwamish River flows mostly hidden between the Industrial District’s shipping containers and cranes and docks. Even before colonists arrived, the estuary was “an industrial area” for the Duwamish Tribe, says James Rasmussen, a former tribal council member and currently the Superfund manager for the Duwamish River Cleanup Coalition. “This was where we harvested so much for the villages to thrive.” He started his work in part because he grew up learning that the fish and wildlife and river were part of his family.

Even after a century of commercial pollution—which had the EPA label it one of the most toxic sites in the U.S. in 2001—salmon still run in the river. Residents of adjacent neighborhoods like South Park fish there. And, slowly, due to two decades of cleanup, the river is healing.

So is our relationship with it. A new book, The River That Made Seattle by BJ Cummings, tells the Duwamish’s long story. And on October 27, the Port of Seattle will announce new, community-selected names for the six parks that dot the river’s shores (currently called things like Terminal 107 Park). Rasmussen says that’s an important step to connect the river with its history and with a better future, to “create a river for all,” where industry and people can healthily coexist.

In these images taken over the last 10 years, photographer David Ryder shows the river’s multiplicity. Here is pollution and refuse: a tangle of tires like a nest of snakes rising from dark water. Here is the returning wildlife. Here are the people who gather on the river’s shores. Rasmussen says the Duwamish is probably the cleanest it’s been in a hundred years, but the work continues. “We can’t relax, we can’t stop,” he says. Like the river itself, “we have to keep moving.”

After a century of unchecked industrial waste, the river is polluted down to the sediment with PCBs, arsenic, dioxin, mercury. Spills used to be weekly and intentional, Rasmussen says. Now they’re down to two or three a year, each quickly contained.

Wildlife is returning to the Duwamish: It now has more biodiversity than anywhere else in Seattle. Here Caspian terns cover the shore near Kellogg Island.

Knowing they needed an industrial area to grow, Rasmussen says, early city planners “looked at this valley, and to them it was worthless because you couldn’t build anything on it… They started filling it with anything they could find, even rubble from the San Francisco earthquake.”

Colorado lawmaker wants to bar convicted animal abusers from owning pets,Colorado law would bar convicted animal abusers from owning pets,1.0,"People convicted of animal abuse could be banned from owning, babysitting or living with an animal if a Denver Democrat’s bill becomes state law.

Judges would also get the option to include therapy or anger management classes as part of a sentence.

“I think the real important piece of this legislation is the component that deals with judges being able to sentence folks to anger management or mental health treatment,” Rep. Alex Valdez, D-Denver, said.“There’s a correlation between people who commit acts of violence against animals and those same people committing acts of violence against people.”

HB19-1092 would give judges the discretion to prohibit adults and juveniles convicted of misdemeanor animal abuse from “owning, possessing, caring for, or residing with an animal of any kind” for a certain number of years. The ban would be mandatory for people convicted of felony animal abuse.

Valdez, a first-year lawmaker, modeled the bill after a California law that bans pet ownership for five years after a misdemeanor conviction and 10 years for a felony. But he said he got some pushback from members of the House Judiciary Committee where the bill is scheduled for its first hearing Thursday. He plans to change it during that hearing to give judges more leeway when it comes to sentencing.

“We’re leaving (misdemeanors) up to judicial discretion,” Valdez said. “They’re dealing with these cases day in and day out, and we don’t want to take away their ability to evaluate cases individually.”

Currently, Valdez said, judges don’t have a lot of discretion when it comes to the pets of people who mistreated an animal.

“As much as I love animals, this bill is about helping people who do these sorts of things, so we can prevent them from committing worse crimes in the future,” Valdez said.

Women in domestic violence shelters were 11 times more likely to report a partner had harmed or killed a pet than women who hadn’t experience domestic violence, according to a 2007 study for Sage Journals. Another study, by researchers at Northeastern University, found people who commit animal abuse were five times more likely to commit violent crime against a person.

Republicans in the Colorado House declined to comment through their spokesperson, but Valdez is optimistic his bill will find support from both parties.

Florida Republican Rick Scott signed a similar bill into law there in March 2018 when he was the governor.

“If Florida can pass this under complete conservative leadership, I think that we have a really good chance of doing this in Colorado as well,” Valdez said.",https://www.denverpost.com/2019/01/29/colorado-animal-abusers-pet-ban/,2601
Irish teenager wins national science award for 'deepfake' video detector,"A teenage student in Ireland has won a national science competition for developing technology that can more easily detect ""deepfake"" videos online.",1.0,"A teenage student in Ireland has won a national science competition for developing technology that can more easily detect ""deepfake"" videos online.

Greg Tarr, from County Cork, was declared the winner of the 2021 BT Young Scientist & Technologist of the Year award last week for his project, ""Towards Deepfake Detection"".

The picture or audio of deepfake videos is altered by artificial intelligence (AI) to make it appear as though someone has said or done something they have not.

The viral spread of deepfake videos has caused international concern, in an age of digital news consumption, and social media companies have come under renewed scrutiny on how to tackle the spread of this misinformation.

An altered video, claiming to show US President-elect Joe Biden falling asleep during a television interview, was widely shared before November's election.

Speaking to Euronews, Tarr said he had developed advanced AI to help detect when a video has been altered.

""I've been working on AI for maybe four years and it's being trained to look at vast amounts of data,"" said Tarr, ""it's a concept that is currently being done, but mine is ten times faster.""

""It's amazing how few people understand how prevalent deepfakes are in current media,"" he added

The 17-year-old student will soon present his work at the European Union's Contest for Young Scientists.

""I look forward to representing my country in September with the same project or maybe an improved version, and I'm also looking forward to commercialising or 'productising' this development.""

""Empress of the Seas did rescue two sailors who had been adrift for more than 20 days,"" the cruise line said in a statement to USA TODAY. ""Both passengers onboard the vessel were provided water and medical attention onboard by the ship’s crew. There were no injuries reported.""

Royal Caribbean's chief meteorologist James Van Fleet documented the rescue on Twitter Friday. He says the stranded sailors were found between Jamaica and Grand Cayman in only a small boat.

""Empress lowered her tender boat at 21:57 and rescued the passengers,"" the Royal Carribean statement added. ""Due to the high swell, the boat was towed close to the ship in order to get shelter.""

Van Fleet added that the Royal Caribbean cruise took a detour from its normal itinerary in pursuit of ""better weather"" and would have not located the castaways otherwise.

“Sometimes a little luck is all you need for a miracle,” Van Fleet said.

Dog deemed ‘unadoptable' to become first-ever deaf K-9 in Washington,Dog deemed ‘unadoptable' to become first-ever deaf K-9 in Washington,1.0,"SEATTLE — When Ghost was a puppy, around 3 months old, he was found homeless in Florida.

He is deaf, with white fur and brown eyes.

Ghost was deemed “unadoptable” because of an abundance of energy and occasional indifference to people. His deafness would also have required owners willing to learn new ways of communicating.

In Florida, young Ghost was scheduled to be euthanized. Swamp Haven Humane in Florida wanted to give Ghost another chance at a forever home.

So they reached out to several animal shelters around the country, including Olympic Peninsula Humane Society in Port Angeles, which agreed to take him in.

Olympic Peninsula Humane knows by now to reach out to Barb Davenport when they have a high-energy puppy. When no one showed interest in adopting Ghost, they called Barb.

Barb started handling dogs when she was a little girl, only 10 years old.

She participated in American Kennel Club conformation and junior showmanship as well as the 4-H dog programs -- then joined the U.S. Army in 1975.

She enlisted in the military specifically to become a K-9 handler, officials with the Washington State Department of Corrections said.

In 1979, she became one.

Barb said she feels the best part of her job is taking dogs who might not be able to find forever homes, and working to help them become important members of their communities.

When she met Ghost for the first time, “he was very focused and determined to locate his ball when thrown or hidden,” Barb said. She felt he could be a good K-9.

At this point, Barb has trained over 450 rescued dogs into narcotics dogs. All of the Washington state DOC’s K-9s are originally from shelters.

Now 2 and a half years old, Ghost lives with his new handler, Joe Henderson. Ghost is in training as a narcotics detection dog for the Washington DOC.

He’ll be with Henderson for the rest of his ""forever,"" helping to serve the community as the first deaf dog in Washington state's K-9 history.

U.S. Marshals Find DOZENS of Missing Children in Georgia,U.S. Marshals Find DOZENS of Missing Children in Georgia - Breaking911,1.0,"Washington, DC – The U.S. Marshals Service Missing Child Unit, in conjunction with the agency’s Southeast Regional Fugitive Task Force, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) and Georgia state and local agencies, led a two-week operation in August in Atlanta and Macon, Georgia, to rescue endangered missing children.

“Operation Not Forgotten” resulted in the rescue of 26 children, the safe location of 13 children and the arrest of nine criminal associates. Additionally, investigators cleared 26 arrest warrants and filed additional charges for alleged crimes related to sex trafficking, parental kidnapping, registered sex offender violations, drugs and weapons possession, and custodial interference. The 26 warrants cleared included 19 arrest warrants for a total of nine individuals arrested, some of whom had multiple warrants.

“The U.S. Marshals Service is fully committed to assisting federal, state, and local agencies with locating and recovering endangered missing children, in addition to their primary fugitive apprehension mission,” said Director of the Marshals Service Donald Washington. “The message to missing children and their families is that we will never stop looking for you.”

These missing children were considered to be some of the most at-risk and challenging recovery cases in the area, based on indications of high-risk factors such as victimization of child sex trafficking, child exploitation, sexual abuse, physical abuse, and medical or mental health conditions. Other children were located at the request of law enforcement to ensure their wellbeing. USMS investigators were able to confirm each child’s location in person and assure their safety and welfare.

The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015 enhanced the U.S. Marshals’ authority to assist federal, state, and local law enforcement with the recovery of missing, endangered or abducted children, regardless of whether a fugitive or sex offender was involved. The Marshals established a Missing Child Unit to oversee and manage the implementation of its enhanced authority under the act.

In 2019, the USMS helped recover 295 missing children based on requests for assistance from law enforcement and has contributed to the recovery of a missing child in 75 percent of cases received. Additionally, of the missing children recovered, 66 percent were recovered within seven days of the USMS assisting with the case. Since its partnership with NCMEC began in 2005, the agency has recovered more than 1,800 missing children.

“When we track down fugitives, it’s a good feeling to know that we’re putting the bad guy behind bars. But that sense of accomplishment is nothing compared to finding a missing child,” said Darby Kirby, Chief of the Missing Child Unit. “It’s hard to put into words what we feel when we rescue a missing child, but I can tell you that this operation has impacted every single one of us out here. We are working to protect them and get them the help they need.”

This initiative was the culmination of several months of planning and coordination between the USMS, NCMEC, Georgia Bureau of Investigation, Georgia Office of the Attorney General, Georgia Department of Family and Children Services, Georgia Department of Juvenile Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta.

Walt Disney Company to eliminate plastic straws and more by 2019,Walt Disney Company to eliminate plastic straws and more by 2019,1.0,"The Walt Disney Company is set to eliminate single-use plastic straws and plastic stirrers at all its owned and operated locations across the globe by mid-2019, the company announced Thursday. This includes all parks with the exception of Disney Tokyo.

That elimination amounts to a reduction of more than 175 million straws and 13 million stirrers annually, the company said.

The move comes on the heels of an announcement from Starbucks earlier this month that would phase out single-use plastic straws from its more than 28,000 stores worldwide by 2020.

“Eliminating plastic straws and other plastic items are meaningful steps in our long-standing commitment to environmental stewardship,” said Bob Chapek, Chairman, Disney Parks, Experiences, and Consumer Products. “These new global efforts help reduce our environmental footprint, and advance our long-term sustainability goals.”

For patrons of Disney hotels and Disney cruise ships, there are additional changes coming.

Over the next several years there will be a transition to refillable in-room amenities, a move that is expected to reduce plastic by 80 percent, the company estimates.

The company also said they will reduce the number of single-use plastic shopping bags in owned and operated parks and on cruise ships, offering guests the option to purchase reusable bags.

“Disney has always been inspired by nature -- and it is a uniquely powerful brand that inspires, educates, and entertains, all at the same time,” said Dr. M. Sanjayan, CEO of Conservation International, a non-profit with which Disney has collaborated on environmental and sustainability initiatives.

“Today’s announcement is more than about reducing single-use plastic waste, it’s also about showing millions of kids and adults from around the world the many ways we can change our daily habits to care for the oceans and protect nature that sustains us all,"" Sanjayan said. ""It also builds on Disney’s longstanding commitment to conservation and environmental stewardship, a legacy that stretches from the highlands of Peru to the islands of the South Pacific.”

In addition to the Walt Disney Company and Starbucks, McDonald's announced in June that it would scrap plastic straws from restaurant locations in the U.K. and Ireland and replace them with paper straws, starting in September. Vail Resorts, owner of Northstar, Heavenly and Kirkwood at Lake Tahoe and sister resorts in Colorado, Utah, British Columbia, Vermont and the Midwest, has also banned plastic straws.

"A 6th-grade teacher wrote 'Invite me to your Harvard graduation!' -- 21 years later, the student did just that","A 6th-grade teacher wrote 'Invite me to your Harvard graduation!' -- 21 years later, the student did just that",1.0,"A sixth-grade teacher from Yuma, Arizona, Toensing made a strong impact on one of her students 21 years ago.

At the end of the school year in 1997, Mrs. Toensing, wrote a note on the student's report card: ""It has been a joy to have you in class. Keep up the good work! Invite me to your Harvard graduation!.""

This week, the student, Christin Gilmer graduated from Harvard as a doctor of public health.

Gilmer who is now 33, was only 12 at the time, but she kept the message all these years.

""It meant a lot to me to know that outside my mom, someone who knew me so intimately believed in my dreams and my ability to accomplish them,"" Gilmer told CNN.

Gilmer, who wrote a thank you note prior to her graduation, said Toensing was the first person to encourage her in the journey of studying public health.

""Ms. Judy Toensing, taught me about current events, global health, and human rights. She was the first person who passionately conveyed the plight of people living with HIV/AIDS to me,"" the letter said.

This letter quickly grabbed the attention of school administrators, who decided to honor Toensing by inviting her to the 2018 Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health's convocation, at no cost to her.

Mrs. Toensing and Gilmer's mom posed for a photo after the ceremony.

""You don't just teach young people. You inspire them, and you propel them along a path of fulfillment and service to others. Your work is what makes our work possible,"" Dean Williams said.

This came to a surprise to Toensing, who felt ""shocked, flabbergasted, humbled"" when she received the invitation from Harvard, which was personally delivered to her by Gilmer.

""I have high expectations of all my students, so to hear that Christin had achieved this goal did not surprise me in the least,"" Toensing told CNN. ""I feel honored that Harvard chose to tell Christin's story, her journey, and that I was a small part of that journey,"" she added.

Christin Gilmer received her doctor of public health degree on May 23, 2018.

Gilmer who got her master's degree in public health at Columbia University, says that Toensing always encouraged her students to think of ways to help others.

""She lit a fire in me that helping people is a powerful tool, and through education, you can better serve populations in need. I will never forget her passion for others,"" Gilmer told CNN.

As a student in Toensing's class, she and others wrote a 100-page advertisement, interviewed the mayor and envisioned how recycling could work in their town 15 years before it actually happened, and helping others is something she plans to focus on.

""I would love return to southern Arizona to work in health, politics, and community development,"" Gilmer said. ""I wanted to learn from the best institutions in the world so that I could bring back the knowledge and skills I have obtained and share them with the communities from which I came.""

Toensing, who says this experience revitalized and energized her to become a better teacher for her students, praised all the hard work Gilmer has done and believes this is just the beginning of a great future.

""She has many more miles to go, I know with her tenacity, her dedication, and her passion for helping humanity, she will be highly successful and that we will all be the better for knowing her,"" Toensing said.

Dad who lunged at Larry Nassar donating GoFundMe earnings to help sexual abuse survivors,Dad who lunged at Larry Nassar donating GoFundMe earnings to help sexual abuse survivors,1.0,"The man who attempted to attack former Michigan State University doctor Larry Nassar during his Eaton County sentencing hearing will be donating earnings from a fundraising account in his name to charity.

Randy Margraves, the father of three victims of Nassar and a member of IBEW 665, lunged at his daughters' former doctor last week after hearing victim impact statements from his daughters in court. He was detained and later released without charges, but a GoFundMe online fundraiser was started in his name.

That fundraiser earned $31,311 before the account was closed, according to a joint statement from Margraves and IBEW 665. Many of the donations came from IBEW members throughout the country.

""While Randy deeply appreciates the outpouring of support, he says it is not needed for him,"" the statement read. ""This situation has demonstrated the strength of the bond among our union brothers and sisters...we're glad to see the money going to organizations that help survivors of abuse.""

Donors can choose to get a refund before March 9, or leave the donation to be given to local charities such as Small Talk, RAVE, and the Firecracker Foundation that help sexual abuse survivors.

""At the time of the incident, I didn't know that the great brotherhood had done this, and I was overcome with gratitude when I found out,"" Margraves said in the statement. ""I appreciate everyone stepping up to support me, but help is not needed for me.""

During Nassar's sentencing hearing last Friday, Margraves was there to to support his two of his daughters, Lauren and Madison, as they gave statements in person in the courtroom Friday.

All three of Randall Margraves' daughters had been sexually abused by Nassar, a prominent sports physician now facing a lifetime in prison for inappropriately touching hundreds of women and girls. All three gave statements in either his Eaton or Ingham county sentencing hearings.

But he didn't know the full extent of what his children were going to say, and after seeing Nassar's reaction, he asked to say a few words.

He called Nassar a son of a bitch, and Judge Janice Cunningham asked him not to swear.

Margraves asked the court to have five minutes alone in a locked room with Nassar, and audience members in the courtroom laughed awkwardly when Cunningham told him she couldn't do that. Then he asked for a minute, and she told him she couldn't let him do that, either.

Without warning, Margraves rushed towards Nassar. Nassar ducked as one of his defense attorneys jumped in front of his client. Margraves was quickly detained, and courtroom proceedings stopped momentarily. He was later released without charges.

Margraves' action sent shockwaves through the courtroom and the country as those who witnessed what happened got a raw glimpse into the devastating pain Nassar's actions had caused the victims and their families.

It sparked the creation of a GoFundMe account in his name, which spread rapidly throughout the day and earned more than $30,000.

He apologized profusely for his actions, noting at a press conference later that day that he was embarrassed.

""I want to make it real clear that I am no hero. My daughters are the heroes and all the victims and the survivors of this terrible atrocity,"" Margraves said on Friday night.",http://www.mlive.com/news/index.ssf/2018/02/dad_who_lunged_at_nassar_donat.html,3295
"Retired firefighter-paramedic spends savings on naloxone, gives it away for free","Instead of Buying New Car, Retired Paramedic Spends $40K on Overdose Prevention Kits, gives them away for free, and had Already Saved 94 Lives",1.0,"This article, originally published Oct. 26, 2017, has been updated with current information

By News Staff

PALM CITY, Fla. — A retired firefighter-paramedic is giving away free naloxone to help fight the opioid epidemic.

WPTV reported that Luis Garcia is using his own savings to buy naloxone doses and hand them out to employees of local businesses that could potentially encounter a drug overdose.

According to the Daytona Beach News-Journal, Garcia has purchased 800 doses of naloxone to distribute across the state as part of his South Florida Opioid Crisis Mortality Reduction Project.

Not only does Garcia hand out the doses, he also gives a 90-minute CPR, AED and naloxone class to instruct the employees on how to respond to an overdose situation.

“I witnessed the AIDS crisis and the cocaine crisis. We’re going to find that the opioid pandemic in the USA will far exceed the number of deaths from all of that combined,” Garcia said. “Virtually all these deaths are preventable.

One woman’s race to defuse the genetic time bomb in her genes,"In 2011, Sonia Vallabh was handed a genetic report that contained a death sentence: she carried the gene for a prion disease, fatal familial insomnia. She quit her job, got a PhD and is now working with Ionis Pharma to develop a potential drug for her condition.",1.0,"In 2011, Sonia Vallabh was handed a genetic report that contained a death sentence. But it also held a map for how to escape.

Her body, she learned, harbored a gene mutation, a single wrong letter of DNA in her “prion” gene, that would eventually lead to a rare brain condition called fatal familial insomnia. Her mother had died of it the year before, and the test had revealed Vallabh had inherited the flaw too.

By now, the decision by Vallabh and her husband, Eric Minikel, to try to prevent her disease—“a prion love story,” the New Yorker called it—is well-known. After the diagnosis of the genetic time bomb, they dropped out of their careers in law and engineering and became scientists dedicated to defusing it. They expect to get PhDs next spring (see “Sonia Vallabh, 35 Innovators Under 35, 2016”.)

Now, after seven years, they think they have found a treatment that can do it. It’s called an antisense drug, a type of mirror-image molecule that, if it reaches the brain, could greatly reduce the amount of the prion protein. That could potentially forestall the mysterious chain reaction of misfolding proteins that characterize prion diseases.

Less of the protein, Vallabh reasons, and less chance she’ll get sick.

Two weeks ago, on their blog, Vallabh announced she and Minikel were working with a commercial partner, the California biotech company Ionis, which specializes in antisense compounds. “For the first time, I am optimistic about a specific therapeutic strategy,” she wrote. It’s “plausible” that antisense could treat the disease “in our lifetime.”

Vallabh’s race to prevent her own prion disease raises a question for the genetic age. Given a perfect DNA blueprint of your inherited disease, what’s your chance of stopping it in your lifetime, or that of someone you love?

There are reasons to think these types of medical long shots have become more likely to hit the mark. That is because gene sequencing can cheaply reveal molecular flaws, but also because a set of promising technologies—antisense, gene therapy, and CRISPR gene editing—are able to replace genes or silence them, in effect fixing genetic problems at their source.

What’s more, these treatments employ the genetic code; they are actually made of DNA or RNA. That means that they’re fundamentally modular and programmable. At least on paper, it is now possible to take any genetic flaw and quickly sketch an antidote.

In reality, drug development is notoriously complicated. Most drugs fail, torn down by biological surprises and unexpected toxicity to the human body. But Vallabh says in the early, confusing days of her quest, she received critical advice from Eric Lander, the biologist who leads the Broad Institute, where she and Minikel now study and work. He told her to focus on the genetic error itself—the blueprint of which was in her diagnosis.

“You need to see what you have in your hand and stop looking,” she recalls him saying.

That meant not waiting to answer important scientific unknowns, like what the prion protein does in the body, or why, when it misfolds, it kills brain cells. “There are so many interesting questions about prion disease,” says Vallabh, who is 34. “And those questions will still be there when we are treating it.”

Prion diseases are profoundly strange because they’re caused not by a virus, but by an infectious protein. They include scrapie in sheep, Kuru (spread by cannibalism), Creutzfelt-Jakob disease, and the human version of mad cow disease.

The key drug insight was that mice engineered to lack the prion protein gene never get sick, even when scientists inject infectious prions into their brains. “The biological concept of a prion is a protein that changes it conformation, and that can template further copies. It’s self-templating. That allows it to spread,” says Kurt Giles, a researcher in the lab at the University of California, San Francisco, where prions were first discovered. “That leads to the idea of reducing the [protein]. The less of it there is, then you will get less templating.”

For genetic therapies, though, there’s a further problem, which is how to get them into the body so that they reach, for instance, billions of brain cells.

Antisense technology, conceived decades ago, had its big breakthrough last year when a drug developed by Ionis proved to be astoundingly effective in treating a childhood neurological disorder, spinal muscular atrophy.

By then, Vallabh and Minikel had been introduced to Ionis, and the company had agreed to provide them with antisense compounds targeted to the prion gene to test in mice. Holly Kordasiewicz, the head of neuroscience at Ionis, recalls the 2014 meeting. “We left the room saying we need to do everything that we can to help these people,” she says.

The company gave Vallabh and Minikel a to-do list, which they quickly worked through. Patient registry? Check. Animal studies? Check. Biomarker to show if a drug is working? That research, too, is under way at a Boston hospital studying prion protein levels in spinal fluid.

“Sonia and Eric are doing this with no real funding, just trying to make it happen,” says Jeff Carroll, another patient scientist (he’s got the mutation for Huntington’s disease), who introduced them to Ionis.

One problem not as easily addressed is that prion disease is astoundingly rare, quickly fatal, and rarely diagnosed in advance. That means there has been no great clamor for treatments. Maybe only 200 people in the U.S. know they have a time bomb like Vallabh, she says, and there’s not a single drug currently in human testing. Early on, Ionis let the pair know the collaboration was strictly academic and not a commercial prospect.

But by blotting out the prion protein at its source, an antisense treatment might help with a range of rare conditions linked to it. Fatal insomnia is vanishingly uncommon, as are cases of mad cow disease, but adding these “ultra-rare” diseases together makes them, as a group, slightly less rare.

Vallabh and Minikel say they now have proof that Ionis’s antisense molecules partly protect mice from prion disease. Those animals given the drug live about 70 percent longer.

Kordasiewicz now terms the program a “commercial” project at Ionis, though it remains too small and early-stage to appear on the company’s pipeline chart of drugs under development. “What changed is the data is looking good enough that we think we can have a drug in five years,” she says.

Vallabh hopes it can all go even faster. The fatal insomnia could begin to afflict her tomorrow, or in 30 years. There’s no way to predict it. She and Minikel just had their first child. The girl was conceived through IVF, and Vallabh says the lab employed a genetic test to assure them she wouldn’t carry the mutation.

To save herself, it’s not going to be enough to have a drug. She needs to get it before she ever falls ill. Yet doctors have little experience giving such a genetic drug over many years as a form of prevention.

Figuring out how to carry off such a study is the next challenge for Vallabh and her husband. It appears they hope the US Food and Drug Administration will permit a prevention trial in patients who carry the prion mutations. Since it can take decades for people to get sick (or not), such a study would instead rely on a biomarker, such as whether antisense injections can reduce prion protein levels in the spinal fluid.

Vallabh told me she would volunteer to take the drug. “The big picture,” she says, “is we are moving much more quickly than anyone could expect due to this beautifully clear genetic blueprint we were handed.”",https://www.technologyreview.com/s/611672/one-womans-race-to-defuse-the-genetic-time-bomb-in-her-genes/?utm_campaign=social_button&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_content=2018-07-23,7755

Kidderminster Shuttle

STOURBRIDGE, England — A 101-year-old British man has returned home after beating coronavirus, according to the hospital that treated him.

The man spent two weeks battling the virus at the Alexandra Hospital in Redditch, England, according to Worcestershire Acute Hospitals National Health Service Trust. The BBC identified the man as Keith Watson; the hospital released only the patient's first name.

The hospital shared a photograph of Watson with staff in a post that said: ""Well done to everyone on Ward 12 at the Alexandra Hospital for looking after Keith so well for the past two weeks.""

Health experts and government officials have long warned the virus preys on the elderly, putting a centenarian such as Watson at high risk.

Matthew Hopkins, chief executive of Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust said: “We are delighted that Keith could be safely discharged home. This is a huge morale boost for our staff who are working day in day out to provide the best possible care for our patients.”

The BBC reports Watson went to the hospital for treatment after a fall but tested positive for COVID-19 after he developed a fever.

The news of Watson's recovery comes on the same day that the condition of Britain's leader continued to improve, according to a statement. Prime Minister Boris Johnson was moved out of an intensive care unit where he was being treated for coronavirus to a regular hospital ward.

Britain's death toll was nearing 8,000 on Thursday, according to Public Health England, increasing by nearly 900 in a 24-hour period.

NASA says hole in the ozone smallest since its discovery in 1982,"Hole in the ozone is now the SMALLEST it has been on record since it was discovered in 1982, NASA confirms",1.0,"The hole in the ozone layer has shrunk to its smallest size since scientists began monitoring it in 1982 because of unusual weather patterns in the upper atmosphere over Antarctica, according to NASA.

The hole fluctuates in size annually and is usually largest during the coldest months in the southern hemisphere, from late September to early October.

The latest observations from space have shown the hole now covers less than 3.9million square miles – a record low and almost half as small as it was during its peak at 6.3million on September 8 only six weeks ago. Experts say the hole is usually around 8 million square miles during this time of year.

Paul Newman, chief scientist for Earth Sciences at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center said it is 'great news for ozone in the Southern Hemisphere'.

But he warned: 'It's important to recognize that what we're seeing this year is due to warmer stratospheric temperatures. It's not a sign that atmospheric ozone is suddenly on a fast track to recovery.'

Between September and October, the hole shrunk to around 3.9 million square miles (10 million square kilometres) — the lowest size at which it has ever been recorded

Observations by NASA and NOAA found that the hole reached its peak dimensions for the year at 6.3 million square miles on September 8

By early October the ozone hole can be seen to have shrunk to around 3.9 million square miles. The Dobson Unit can be seen on the left, measuring the amount of a trace gas in a vertical column through the Earth's atmosphere

The hole in the ozone was at its largest in September 2006, when it covered a massive 10.6million square miles

WHAT IS THE OZONE LAYER? Ozone is a molecule comprised of three oxygen atoms that occurs naturally in small amounts. In the stratosphere, roughly seven to 25 miles above Earth's surface, the ozone layer acts like sunscreen, shielding the planet from potentially harmful ultraviolet radiation. It is produced in tropical latitudes and distributed around the globe. Closer to the ground, ozone can also be created by photochemical reactions between the sun and pollution from vehicle emissions and other sources, forming harmful smog. In the 1970s, it was recognised that chemicals called CFCs, used for example in refrigeration and aerosols, were destroying ozone in the stratosphere. In 1987, the Montreal Protocol was agreed, which led to the phase-out of CFCs and, recently, the first signs of recovery of the Antarctic ozone layer. At lower latitudes, the upper stratosphere is also showing clear signs of recovery, suggesting the Montreal Protocol is working well. Advertisement

According to NASA, the 'main ingredient' in the ozone-destroying process is are so-called polar stratospheric clouds.

These relatively rare bodies occur high in the stratosphere at altitudes between 49,000–82,000 feet (15,000–25,000 metres) above the surface.

These clouds provide a surface on which chemical reactions can occur — releasing waste products called 'free radicals' which go on to destroy ozone particles around them.

Fewer polar stratospheric clouds form in warmer weather, however, and they also last for shorter periods of time in such conditions.

This year's warmer global temperatures — aided by unusual weather patterns — have therefore helped to limit the development of these clouds and also given those did form less time to damage the ozone layer.

In turn, this has led to a much smaller ozone hole this year than we have previously seen.

On the surface, the strengthening of the ozone layer would seem to be a promising development — as such serves to better protect the Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation from the Sun.

However, the news that the hole is shrinking is not necessarily a good sign — as the process that is closing the hole is a clear product of rising global temperatures.

In years with more typical weather, the hole usually reaches a maximum size of about 8million square miles by late September or early October — before shrinking back down again.

Gases released from man-made processes on Earth are eroding away the layer of ozone gas which surrounds the globe. Holes in the layer mean more heat from the Sun makes it through and down to Earth level, which is warming the surface and oceans

The highly reactive ozone molecule — also known as trioxygen — comprises three oxygen atoms and is a pale blue gas with a pungent smell.

It can be found 25 miles above the Earth's surface, in the stratosphere.

By reacting with high-energy, ultraviolet rays the ozone acts like a layer of sun screen — absorbing the harmful rays in the stratosphere before they reach Earth's surface.

Ozone is created primarily by ultraviolet radiation, when high-energy ultraviolet rays strike ordinary oxygen molecules (O2).

This splits the molecule into two single oxygen atoms — dubbed 'atomic oxygen' — with the freed oxygen atoms going on to combine with regular oxygen molecules to form ozone (O3).

This reaction helps shield the planet from potentially harmful ultraviolet radiation that can cause skin cancer, cataracts, suppress immune systems and also damage plants.

The Antarctic ozone 'hole', which is technically not a hole but an area of depletion, forms during the Southern Hemisphere's late winter as the returning Sun's rays start ozone-depleting reactions.

These runaway reactions involve chemically active forms of chlorine and bromine derived from man-made compounds and take place on the surfaces of cloud particles in cold stratospheric layers — breaking up ozone molecules.

Warmer temperatures mean fewer polar stratospheric clouds form, limiting the ozone-depletion that can take place on their surface.

NASA and NOAA monitor the ozone hole using satellites including NASA's Aura satellite, the NASA-NOAA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership satellite and NOAA's Joint Polar Satellite System NOAA-20 satellite.

At the South Pole, NOAA staff launch weather balloons carrying ozone-measuring 'sondes' which directly sample ozone levels vertically through the atmosphere.

Most years, at least some levels of the stratosphere —the region of the upper atmosphere where the largest amounts of ozone are normally found — are completely devoid of ozone.

Bryan Johnson at NOAA's Earth System Research Laboratory in Boulder, Colorado said: 'This year, ozonesonde measurements at the South Pole did not show any portions of the atmosphere where ozone was completely depleted.'

While this is uncommon, it is not unprecedented. This is the third time in the last 40 years that weather systems have caused warm temperatures that limit ozone depletion, said Susan Strahan, an atmospheric scientist with Universities Space Research Association, who works at NASA Goddard.

The polar solar vortex seen in red over the south pole which was unusually 'wonky' this year

Similar weather patterns in the Antarctic stratosphere in September 1988 and 2002 also produced atypically small ozone holes, she said.

Dr Strahan said: 'It's a rare event that we're still trying to understand. If the warming hadn't happened, we'd likely be looking at a much more typical ozone hole.'

There is no identified connection between the occurrence of these unique patterns and changes in climate.

The weather systems that disrupted the 2019 ozone hole are typically modest in September, but this year they were unusually strong, dramatically warming the Antarctic's stratosphere during the pivotal time for ozone destruction.

At an altitude of about 12 miles (20 kilometers), temperatures during September were 29F (16˚C) warmer than average, the warmest in the 40-year historical record for September by a wide margin.

In addition, these weather systems also weakened the Antarctic polar vortex, knocking it off its normal center over the South Pole and reducing the strong September jet stream around Antarctica from a mean speed of 161 miles per hour to a speed of 67 miles per hour.

This slowing vortex rotation allowed air to sink in the lower stratosphere where ozone depletion occurs, meaning the Antarctic lower stratosphere was warmed - limiting polar stratospheric clouds where the ozone destroying reactions take place.

The strong weather systems also brought ozone-rich air from higher latitudes elsewhere in the Southern Hemisphere to the area above the Antarctic ozone hole.

A combination of these two effects led to much higher than normal ozone levels over Antarctica compared to ozone hole conditions usually present since the mid 1980s.

As of October 16, the ozone hole above Antarctica remained small but stable and is expected to gradually dissipate in the coming weeks.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-7599369/Hole-ozone-smallest-discovery-1982-NASA-confirms.html,9082

"Former N.J. woman uses couponing to try and feed 30,000 people in need","N.J. woman uses couponing to feed 30,000 people in need",1.0,"When she first learned about couponing, her eyes lit up.

Not because of the potential deals on her groceries. For New Jersey native Lauren Puryear, she realized that couponing was the tool she'd been looking for to bring thousands of meals to people in need.

She has set a goal of delivering 30,000 meals to people who are food insecure by her 30th birthday.

Puryear, 29, currently a Woodbridge, Virg. resident who is a mental health clinician, has been spending years of her time helping to feed the hungry.

It all began four years ago after the death of her grandmother, who had strongly instilled the importance of helping others.

To continue her grandmother's legacy, in 2012, she started an organization, For The Love of Others, which aims to assist people of all backgrounds ""through providing opportunities to enable them to live a purposeful life,"" according to its website.

Though she had been buying food in bulk from stores like Cosco and BJ's, or from online stores like eBay and Amazon, it wasn't enough. She wanted to reach more people.

So, when someone told her about couponing, she quickly realized she could use this old pastime to reach not hundreds, but tens of thousands of hungry people.

""I started couponing for food items like spaghetti, meatballs, and I was (often) able to get the items for free or for little to no money,"" she explained.

If done correctly, she said she can feed as many as 150 people on just $20, depending on the items.

""There are coupons in the Sunday paper, or online that you can print ... so I collect as many as I can, match them to the store and that is how I am able to get the items for free,"" she said.

Though it appears to be a meticulous process, she said once you get the hang of it, it is fairly easy, just requiring a bit of persistence and willingness.

But for Puryear, bringing meals to those in need remains her passion.

When she's not working at her job, the single mother of a five-year-old son toils at bringing meals to people in New Jersey, in Washington, D.C., in Baltimore, and beyond.

So far, she has delivered 5,000 meals. She's confident she will reach her goal by next year.

""It's probably the most exhilarating thing I could ever do in life,"" she said.

Puryear holds four degrees, including a bachelor's, two masters, and a Ph.D. in psychology.

But beyond those accomplishments, she said, ""The joy of helping other people does not compare to any other accomplishment in my life.""

But she also does not forget to pass along to her son what her grandmother had passed along to the rest of her family.

""It is very important to teach him to help other people,"" she said. ""The little things we take for granted, the food we throw away every day ... and if we just spread a little more love around, the world would be such a better place.""

"Legalising gay marriage caused dramatic fall in suicides across Sweden and Denmark, study finds","Legalising gay marriage is dramatically lowering suicides rates, study shows",1.0,"Being allowed to marry has led to a drop in the number of gay men and lesbians taking their own lives in two Scandinavian countries, according to a study.

A 46 per cent fall in suicides among people in same-sex marriages was recorded by comparing two time periods in Denmark and Sweden – from 1989 to 2002, and 2003 to 2016.

Researchers said that reduced stigma around homosexual relationships was likely to be among the reasons for the drop.

“Being married is protective against suicide,” said Annette Erlangsen of the Danish Research Institute for Suicide Prevention. “Legalising same-sex marriage and other supportive legislative measures – they might actually reduce stigma around sexual minorities.”

Same-sex marriage was made legal in 2009 in Sweden and 2012 in Denmark. The unions are now legal in 27 countries, 16 of them in Europe. Ecuador became the latest nation to permit them, in June this year.

However, people in same-sex marriages still took their own lives at more than twice the rate of those in heterosexual unions across both periods, reinforcing research from other countries that points to a higher incidence of suicide attempts among LGBT+ people.

Young LGBT+ people are at least three times more likely to attempt suicide than their straight peers, according to 35 studies from 10 countries collated by researchers in 2018.

Dr Erlangsen’s study, which followed more than 28,000 people in same-sex unions for an average of 11 years, found married lesbians were 2.8 times as likely to die by suicide as women in straight marriages, and slightly more likely than straight, married men. Men in gay partnerships were most likely to kill themselves.

“There still remains a considerable degree of homophobia, particularly against male homosexuals,” said Morten Frisch, of Denmark’s Statens Serum Institut, a research body. “Just under one in three men still consider it morally unacceptable that two men have sex with each other,” he said, citing a survey of more than 62,000 Danes released in October.

India Will Ban All Single-Use Plastics by 2022,India saying it will ban all single use plastics by 2022,1.0,"News

First comes the leak, then comes the flood.

2018 will be remembered as the year the world waged war on plastic waste — and the revolution has just got serious.

India announced it will ban all single-use plastics by 2022 in the most important leap forward against plastic pollution to date.

Take Action: Call on Governments to Say 'No' to Single-Use Plastics

Prime Minister Modi delivered the bold plan on Tuesday, described by the Guardian as the “most ambitious” move yet against global plastic pollution.

India is the fastest-growing economy in the world, and home to 1.3 billion people. Approximately 15,342 tonnes of plastic waste are wasted by Indians every single day, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), and about 60% of that is recycled — far higher than the global average of 14%.

The quest for material prosperity cant lead to environmental degradation. We must remember that an unclean environment hurts the poor and vulnerable the most. pic.twitter.com/yBX7q6IfQn — Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) June 5, 2018

It comes just days after Tamil Nadu, a southern Indian state home to 72 million people, announced it will ban single-use plastics like polythene bags and bottles. That ban will come into force from next year, and will exclude some essential goods like milk, medicines, and oil, according to The Hindu.

It’s part of a wide series of reforms announced for World Environment Day on Tuesday, which India is hosting in 2018.

“The choices that we make today will define our collective future,” said Modi. “The choices may not be easy. But through awareness, technology, and a genuine global partnership, I am sure we can make the right choices. Let us all join together to beat plastic pollution and make this planet a better place to live.”

“Environmental degradation hurts the poor and vulnerable the most,” he continued. “It is the duty of each one of us to ensure that material prosperity does not compromise our environment.”

India also announced a campaign on marine litter, and a move to measure plastic in coastal waters, according to the Guardian. Prime Minister Modi also pledged to make 100 national monuments, including the Taj Mahal, litter-free.

If Modi can deliver on this promise to ""abolish all single-use plastics in India by 2022"", it will be a huge step forwards. It also makes @theresa_may's ""ambition"" to ""end avoidable plastic waste in the UK by 2042"" look ditheringly, dangerously slow. https://t.co/WVe8xXvqp3 — Robert Macfarlane (@RobGMacfarlane) June 6, 2018

On Tuesday the UN released their biggest ever report on plastic pollution. It confirmed that over 50 states were taking action on the issue, including total bans on plastic bags in Kenya and Rwanda. The report also revealed that the Galapagos is set to ban single-use plastics, Sri Lanka will ban styrofoam, and China will insist on biodegradable bags only.

However, the report concluded that far more still must be done to stop plastic entering oceans and rivers.

Approximately 380 million tonnes of plastic are created globally every year — and 8 million tonnes enter the ocean, putting sea life at risk. Remember the whale that died in Thailand after eating 80 plastic bags just last week? It’s the rule, not the exception.

The average plastic bag can take up to 1,000 years to break down — but Modi’s announcement proves that momentum towards tangible change can happen overnight. All it takes is political will — and as Al Gore once told Global Citizen, that is in itself a renewable resource.

Scientists find a way to enhance the performance of quantum computers,Scientists find a way to enhance the performance of quantum computers,1.0,"Credit: CC0 Public Domain

USC scientists have demonstrated a theoretical method to enhance the performance of quantum computers, an important step to scale a technology with potential to solve some of society's biggest challenges.

The method addresses a weakness that bedevils performance of the next-generation computers by suppressing erroneous calculations while increasing fidelity of results, a critical step before the machines can outperform classic computers as intended. Called ""dynamical decoupling,"" it worked on two quantum computers, proved easier and more reliable than other remedies and could be accessed via the cloud, which is a first for dynamical decoupling.

The technique administers staccato bursts of tiny, focused energy pulses to offset ambient disturbances that muck sensitive computations. The researchers report they were able to sustain a quantum state up to three times longer than would otherwise occur in an uncontrolled state.

""This is a step forward,"" said Daniel Lidar, professor of electrical engineering, chemistry and physics at USC and director of the USC Center for Quantum Information Science and Technology (CQIST). ""Without error suppression, there's no way quantum computing can overtake classical computing.""

The results were published today in the journal Physical Review Letters. Lidar is the Viterbi Professor of Engineering at USC and corresponding author of the study; he led a team of researchers at CQIST, which is a collaboration between the USC Viterbi School of Engineering and the USC Dornsife School of Letters, Arts and Sciences. IBM and Bay Area startup Rigetti Computing provided cloud access to their quantum computers.

Quantum computers are fast, but fragile

Quantum computers have the potential to render obsolete today's super computers and propel breakthroughs in medicine, finance and defense capabilities. They harness the speed and behavior of atoms, which function radically different than silicon computer chips, to perform seemingly impossible calculations.

Quantum computing has the potential to optimize new drug therapies, models for climate change and designs for new machines. They can achieve faster delivery of products, lower costs for manufactured goods and more efficient transportation. They are powered by qubits, the subatomic workhorses and building blocks of quantum computing.

But qubits are as temperamental as high-performance race cars. They are fast and hi-tech, but prone to error and need stability to sustain computations. When they don't operate correctly, they produce poor results, which limits their capabilities relative to traditional computers. Scientists worldwide have yet to achieve a ""quantum advantage—the point where a quantum computer outperforms a conventional computer on any task.

The problem is ""noise,"" a catch-all descriptor for perturbations such as sound, temperature and vibration. It can destabilize qubits, which creates ""decoherence,"" an upset that disrupts the duration of the quantum state, which reduces time a quantum computer can perform a task while achieving accurate results.

""Noise and decoherence have a large impact and ruin computations, and a quantum computer with too much noise is useless,"" Lidar explained. ""But if you can knock down the problems associated with noise, then you start to approach the point where quantum computers become more useful than classic computers.""

USC research spans multiple quantum computing platforms

USC is the only university in the world with a quantum computer; its 1098-qubit D-Wave quantum annealer specializes in solving optimization problems. Part of the USC-Lockheed Martin Center for Quantum Computing, it's located at USC's Information Sciences Institute. However, the latest research findings were achieved not on the D-Wave machine, but on smaller scale, general-purpose quantum computers: IBM's 16-qubit QX5 and Rigetti's 19-qubit Acorn.

To achieve dynamical decoupling (DD), the researchers bathed the superconducting qubits with tightly focused, timed pulses of minute electromagnetic energy. By manipulating the pulses, scientists were able to envelop the qubits in a microenvironment, sequestered—or decoupled—from surrounding ambient noise, thus perpetuating a quantum state.

""We tried a simple mechanism to reduce error in the machines that turned out to be effective,"" said Bibek Pokharel, an electrical engineering doctoral student at USC Viterbi and first author of the study.

The time sequences for the experiments were exceedingly small with up to 200 pulses spanning up to 600 nanoseconds. One-billionth of a second, or a nanosecond, is how long it takes for light to travel one foot.

For the IBM quantum computers, final fidelity improved threefold, from 28.9 percent to 88.4 percent. For the Rigetti quantum computer, final fidelity improvement was a more modest 17 percent, from 59.8 to 77.1, according to the study. The scientists tested how long fidelity improvement could be sustained and found that more pulses always improved matters for the Rigetti computer, while there was a limit of about 100 pulses for the IBM computer.

Overall, the findings show the DD method works better than other quantum error correction methods that have been attempted so far, Lidar said.

""To the best of our knowledge,"" the researchers wrote, ""this amounts to the first unequivocal demonstration of successful decoherence mitigation in cloud-based superconducting qubit platforms ... we expect that the lessons drawn will have wide applicability.""

High stakes in the race for quantum supremacy

The quest for quantum computing supremacy is a geopolitical priority for Europe, China, Canada, Australia and the United States. Advantage gained by acquiring the first computer that renders all other computers obsolete would be enormous and bestow economic, military and public health advantages to the winner.

Congress is considering two new bills to establish the United States as a leader in quantum computing. In September, the House of Representatives passed the National Quantum Initiative Act to allocate $1.3 billion in five years to spur research and development. It would create a National Quantum Coordination Office in the White House to supervise research nationwide. A separate bill, the Quantum Computing Research Act by Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., directs the Department of Defense to lead a quantum computing effort.

""Quantum computing is the next technological frontier that will change the world and we cannot afford to fall behind,"" Harris said in prepared remarks. ""It could create jobs for the next generation, cure diseases and above all else make our nation stronger and safer. ... Without adequate research and coordination in quantum computing, we risk falling behind our global competition in the cyberspace race, which leaves us vulnerable to attacks from our adversaries,"" she said.

Arkansas city paying homeless $9.25 an hour to collect trash,Arkansas city paying homeless $9.25 an hour to collect trash,1.0,"Arkansas has been paying homeless people $9.25 an hour — two bucks more than the federal minimum wage — to pick up trash around its state capital.

And the program in Little Rock, dubbed Bridge to Work, has been so successful since it began in April that the city’s mayor, Frank Scott Jr., is planning to extend it an additional year, according to 12 News Now.

“We’re super excited about what has gone on, and we hope to be able to keep the momentum going,” said associate pastor Paul Atkins of the Canvas Community Church, which runs the program, the news outlet reported.

“We want to work with them on their next step,” Atkins said during a board meeting last month. “There are a lot of barriers that our people experience to go from homelessness and panhandling to full-time work. There’s a lot of steps in between.”

The Bridge to Work program originally was planned to last just six months but will be extended to go through the end of September 2020, according to the site.

According to Atkins, 380 people joined the work crews, with some joining more than once.

A total of 130 sites have been cleaned, 2,056 bags filled with trash and 1,821 hours worked since the program started, the news outlet reported.

Zero elephants poached in a year in top Africa wildlife park,"One of Africa's largest wildlife preserves is marking a year without a single elephant found killed by poachers, which experts call an extraordinary development in an area larger than Switzerland where thousands of the animals have been slaughtered in recent years",1.0,"Zero elephants found killed by poachers in a year in one of Africa's largest wildlife reserves

JOHANNESBURG -- One of Africa's largest wildlife preserves is marking a year without a single elephant found killed by poachers, which experts call an extraordinary development in an area larger than Switzerland where thousands of the animals have been slaughtered in recent years.

The apparent turnaround in Niassa reserve in a remote region of northern Mozambique comes after the introduction of a rapid intervention police force and more assertive patrolling and response by air, according to the New York-based Wildlife Conservation Society, which manages the reserve with Mozambique's government and several other partners.

Monitoring of the vast reserve with aerial surveys and foot patrols remains incomplete and relies on sampling, however. And despite the sign of progress, it could take many years for Niassa's elephant population to rebuild to its former levels even if poaching is kept under control.

Aggressive poaching over the years had cut the number of Niassa's elephants from about 12,000 to little over 3,600 in 2016, according to an aerial survey. Anti-poaching strategies from 2015 to 2017 reduced the number killed but the conservation group called the rate still far too high.

The new interventions, with Mozambican President Felipe Nyusi personally authorizing the rapid intervention force, have led partners to hope that Niassa's elephants ""stand a genuine chance for recovery,"" the conservation group said.

""It is a remarkable achievement,"" James Bampton, country director with the Wildlife Conservation Society, told The Associated Press. He said he discovered the year free of poaching deaths while going through data.

The last time an elephant in the Niassa reserve was recorded killed by a poacher was May 17, 2018, he said.

Political will is a key reason for the success, Bampton said, with Mozambique's president keen to see poaching reduced.

Bampton acknowledged that the low number of remaining elephants is also a factor in the decline in poaching. A year ago, he estimated that fewer than 2,000 elephants remained in Niassa, though he now says preliminary analysis of data from a survey conducted in October and not yet published indicated that about 4,000 elephants are in the reserve.

Still, a year that appears to be free of elephant poaching in the sprawling reserve drew exclamations from some wildlife experts.

""It is a major and very important development that poaching has ceased. This represents a major success,"" George Wittemyer, who chairs the scientific board for the Kenya-based organization Save the Elephants, told the AP.

The new rapid intervention police force is an elite unit that is better-armed than the reserve's normal rangers and has ""a bit of a reputation of being quite hard,"" Bampton said, adding that no ""bad incidents"" have been reported in Niassa.

Members of the force are empowered to arrest suspected poachers, put together a case within 72 hours and submit it to the local prosecutor, Bampton said. ""Just being caught with a firearm is considered intent to illegal hunting,"" with a maximum prison sentence of 16 years.

Wildlife experts have seen gains elsewhere in Africa against elephant poaching. Tanzania's Selous Game Reserve, widely acknowledged as ""Ground Zero"" for poaching and linked to the Niassa reserve by a wildlife corridor, also has seen a recent decline in the killings.

African elephant poaching has declined to pre-2008 levels after reaching a peak in 2011, according to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species.

But experts say the rate of annual elephant losses still exceeds the birth rate, and the encroachment of human settlements is reducing the animals' range. Africa's elephant population has plummeted from an estimated several million around 1900 to at least 415,000, according to surveys in recent years.

Collaboration and ""huge effort"" among the Niassa reserve's partners has been crucial but data show that issues remain with other iconic species such as lions, said Rob Harris, country manager for Fauna & Flora International, which supports one of the operators in the reserve. ""So the combination of national-level support and on-the-ground effort must be maintained to improve the situation for all wildlife.""

‘Thought she might not make it;’ Henrico 5th grader saves choking friend,5th grader saves choking classmate. He knew what to do by remembering a documentary he watched years ago. At first his parents said they thought he meant he saved a life when playing a video game.,1.0,"HENRICO COUNTY, Va. – A fifth grader in Henrico has been hailed a hero for jumping into action when he saw a classmate choking at lunch; she was starting to turn colors and gasping for breath.

“I wasn`t really calm, my heart was racing I just knew I had to help her,” said Benjamin Ford.

Though he was nervous, school officials said the fifth grader had all the right moves. Benjamin said he knew what to do because he relied on information that he learned in a documentary a few years ago, which he watched with his mom.

Ben was recognized by Greenwood Elementary school administrators, who shared the story of his heroic intervention with the entire school.

His parents said they were super proud of how quickly he acted and are thankful he remembered the documentary.

“I felt like I had to hurry up and get to her,” Benjamin said. “…I thought in a couple more seconds she might not make it.”

“I got a lot of claps and I had a lot of fist bumps and they were really supportive when I walked down the hall,” Benjamin said.

At first his parents said they thought he meant he saved a life when playing a video game.

“Then we found out it was a real person we were shocked....it was awesome,” his mom said.

Benjamin got a big thank you and hug from his friend. He said his parents also picked him up the next day and let him pick out a video game and go to the Black Panther movie.",http://wtvr.com/2018/02/19/thought-she-might-not-make-it-henrico-5th-grader-saves-choking-friend/,1388
We Reported on a Nonprofit Hospital System That Sues Poor Patients. It Just Freed Thousands From Debt.,We Reported on a Nonprofit Hospital System That Sues Poor Patients. It Just Freed Thousands From Debt.,1.0,"ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they’re published. This article was produced in partnership with MLK50, which is a member of the ProPublica Local Reporting Network.

MEMPHIS, Tenn. — The city’s largest nonprofit hospital system has erased the debts owed by more than 6,500 patients it sued for unpaid hospital bills, less than two months after announcing an overhaul of its debt collection processes.

The dramatic shift was prompted by an MLK50-ProPublica investigation that revealed that Methodist Le Bonheur Healthcare filed more than 8,300 debt lawsuits from 2014 through 2018, including against its own employees. Methodist had doggedly pursued low-income defendants who had little ability to pay, often garnishing their meager paychecks.

The single-page “case satisfied” notices filed by Methodist are coming into the Shelby County General Sessions Court faster than staff can process them. A court administrator estimated a backlog of about 4,500 Methodist notices waiting to be entered into the court’s system.

From July 30 through Tuesday, the court had logged more than 2,300 notices submitted by the hospital system that wiped away patients’ debts. That’s more than nine times the number of notices filed by Methodist in the first six months of 2019.

For now, it appears that Methodist is no longer using the courts as a collection agency, a practice that was roundly criticized by health care experts, some elected officials and members of the United Methodist Church, with which Methodist is affiliated. Since July 3, the hospital has not filed any new debt collection lawsuits or garnishment attempts.

Methodist’s turnaround elated defendants and consumer advocates.

Among the defendants who no longer owe is Carrie Barrett, a part-time Kroger employee featured in one of the MLK50-ProPublica articles. Barrett’s case began in July 2007, when a two-night stay at Methodist Bonheur Healthcare, where doctors performed a heart catherization, left her with a $12,019 bill. In 2010, Methodist sued her for more than $16,000, one-third of which was attorney’s fees.

Over the years, thanks to interest and court costs, Barrett’s debt climbed to more than $33,000. If she paid $100 per month as ordered by the court, she would be 90 by the time she paid it off.

Barrett said she received a call nearly two weeks ago from an administrator who said the hospital had reviewed her records. “He said, ‘The balance is zero. ... I said, ‘You don’t know how good that sounds to my ears.’”

Jessica Curtis, a senior adviser at Community Catalyst, a national advocacy organization, has followed other nonprofit hospitals that have been the subject of similar media reports.

“I was trying to remember when have I seen such a rapid switch,” Curtis said. “I don’t know that I’ve seen that before. The scale of what they are attempting to rectify is really commendable from what we’ve seen thus far.”

Because the case satisfied notices do not include the amount owed, the total dollar amount of debt Methodist forgave could not immediately be quantified.

Methodist did not answer questions about how much debt it had forgiven or how many additional cases it has yet to review.

""We are implementing the policies and practices we announced in July, and we have reached out individually to patients who currently have legal proceedings to provide information related to their specific situation,"" a hospital spokesperson said in a statement sent Tuesday evening.

The hospital said formal letters to the patients were sent last week, and patients with questions should call the hospital's billing department at 901–842–1260. No date has been set to resume court collections.

Nonprofit hospitals are generally exempt from local, state and federal taxes. In return, the federal government expects them to provide a significant community benefit, including charity care and financial assistance.

Methodist, which operates five hospitals in Shelby County, does provide some charity care — but experts faulted it for its aggressive collections practices in a city where nearly 1 in 4 residents live below the poverty line.

Its handling of poor patients began with a financial assistance policy that, unlike many of its peers around the country, all but ignored patients with any form of health insurance, no matter their out-of-pocket costs. If they were unable to afford their bills, patients then faced what experts said is rare: A licensed collection agency owned by the hospital.

Lawsuits followed. Finally, after the hospital won a judgment, it would repeatedly try to garnish patients’ wages, which it did in a far higher share of cases than other nonprofit hospitals in Memphis.

Methodist repeatedly refused to make its executives available for interviews, but it sent statements defending itself, noting how it is the only health care system that has hospitals in all four quadrants of Shelby County and that it provided more than $226 million in community benefit. It did not address why its financial assistance policy was less generous than those of its peers or why it garnished wages in a higher percentage of cases than other hospitals.

But on June 30, three days after the MLK50-ProPublica investigation was published, Methodist CEO Michael Ugwueke said in a column published in The Commercial Appeal that the hospital would spend the next 30 days reviewing its collections and financial assistance policies.

Days later, Methodist announced it would suspend court collection activities over unpaid hospital bills. In the weeks that followed, the hospital’s attorney, R. Alan Pritchard, dropped dozens of suits that had been on the court docket.

On July 30, the hospital announced wide-reaching reforms. “We were humbled to learn that while there’s so much good happening across our health system each day, we can and must do more,” Ugwueke said in a media conference call.

Under the new policy, financial assistance will be provided to patients earning up to 250% of the federal poverty line, or $53,325 for a family of three. The previous policy applied to uninsured patients with incomes up to 125% of the federal poverty line. Methodist said more than half of the population of greater Memphis would be eligible for assistance under the new policy.

The hospital also said it would no longer accept court-ordered interest on medical debt nor would it seek to collect attorney’s fees or court costs from patients.

And it said it would raise its minimum wage to $13.50 an hour by mid-September and to $15 an hour by January 2021. The lowest-paid employees made $10 an hour and about 18% of workers earned less than $15 an hour, the hospital reported in response to MLK50’s 2018 Living Wage Survey.

The pay increase signaled that Methodist took the issue seriously, Curtis said. “The inclusion of wages means someone has realized not just the symptom of the problem but the core root of the problem. This is a clearly promising start,” she said.

It’s unclear whether Methodist will resume suing patients for unpaid bills. And the hospital has not said how many additional “case satisfied notices” it could file. Plaintiffs cannot refile lawsuits after the case has been marked satisfied.

One of the defendants featured in the investigation was a Methodist housekeeper, who asked that her name not be used for fear that the hospital would fire her for talking to a reporter.

In 2017, Methodist sued her for the cost of hospital stays to treat chronic abdominal pain she experienced before the hospital hired her. She owed about $23,000, including around $5,800 in attorney’s fees.

Read More The Nonprofit Hospital That Makes Millions, Owns a Collection Agency and Relentlessly Sues the Poor In Memphis, Methodist Le Bonheur Healthcare has brought 8,300 lawsuits for unpaid medical bills in just five years.

In January, a General Sessions Court judge ordered her to pay $75 biweekly. The housekeeper paid reliably until this summer, when she missed several days of work because she was sick, eventually ending up in the hospital. That left her paycheck short.

She received a small annual raise in August, and another to $13.50 less than two weeks ago

Last week, a reporter showed the housekeeper a copy of her case satisfied notice.

“God is a good God,” she said, laughing and smiling. “I’ve been calling them and they tell me nothing. … This is a blessing right here.”

Barrett, the Kroger employee featured in the first MLK50-ProPublica story, likewise praised God. At church this month, Barrett had an update for the congregation, which had heard her speak about her financial troubles before.

“I have a zero balance,” she said. “I just want to thank God for blessings that he has brought to me. … I thank him for the victory!” she shouted, as others joined her in praise.

“Victory is ours, amen!” a minister said from the pulpit. “Don’t y’all know that Jesus will drop those charges? Glory to God!”

To see if a case satisfied notice has been logged in your case, enter your seven-digit docket number in the CourtConnect online lookup system under “Display case information and activities.” If your case has been satisfied, the last docket entry will say “Case Satisfied.”

You can also enter your docket number into the court’s civil online payment system, which will show the amount due.

INDEPENDENCE, Mo. — In this season of giving thanks, one student shows what generosity is all about. When one young lady from Missouri found a financial windfall, she gave it to others in need, overlooking her own needs.

7-year-old Phoebe Brown says she knew exactly what she’d found, and how best to use it. The second grade student from Sycamore Hills Elementary School in Independence was shopping with her mother at the Hy-Vee store on U.S. Highway 40 on November 9th when she found a winning lottery ticket on the floor inside the store.

The Brown family says Phoebe often picks up discarded lottery tickets. They were already at a gas station down the street when she realized she’d found a winner.

“She’s like, ‘Mom, Mom, it’s a winner!’ I said, ‘No it’s not’,” Audrey Brown, Phoebe’s mother, said. “It was. It was a $100 winner.”

The numbers were already scratched off that Missouri Lottery ticket, which bore the logo of the Missouri Tigers, and Phoebe knew a winner when she saw one.

“I saw that lottery ticket and it had a two on the back. I thought I’d better pick it up, and I told my mom it was a winner,” Phoebe told FOX 4 News.

“Everything went through my mind. What could we do with it? What could Phoebe do with it?” Audrey Brown said.

Rather than to spend it on herself, young Phoebe decided to help others.

Sycamore Hills Elementary School has been collecting canned goods for the less-fortunate, as part of the Independence School District’s 150th anniversary. Phoebe decided to donate the money to feed others. School district leaders say the Browns bought $100 worth of groceries at a local store to add to the room filled with donations.

“There have been times where I’ve been out of work, and we had nowhere to stay and our family’s taken us in, and helped us out. We’re thankful for our friends and our family,” Joshua Brown, Phoebe’s dad, said.

And as a promise, the school’s gym teacher, Herb Horseman, allowed the entire second grade to shave his long, bushy beard – Phoebe’s donation helped them win that prize.

”You’re welcome and I hope you have a happy Thanksgiving,” Phoebe said.

Phoebe told FOX 4 News her parents also taught her to be thoughtful and kind to others. Her contribution at the holiday season will go toward providing meals for families who couldn’t otherwise afford to celebrate Thanksgiving.

All told, the Sycamore Hills kids collected over 1,700 canned goods and household items. Second graders at the school accounted for 541 of those donations. School officials say they’ll all go to help less fortunate families within the Independence School District.",http://fox2now.com/2016/11/23/girl-spots-discarded-winning-lottery-scratcher-spends-money-on-thanksgiving-for-those-in-need/,2776
"Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation Unveils $20M in Grants for Climate Change, Wildlife Conservation","Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation Unveils $20M in Grants for Climate Change, Wildlife Conservation",1.0,"The Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation on Tuesday announced its largest-ever portfolio of environmental grants, bringing its total amount of financial impact to over $80 million since its formation in 1998.

The new grants will offer $20 million to more than 100 organizations supporting such causes as wildlife and habitat conservation and climate programs.

DiCaprio announced the grants at a climate change conference at Yale University hosted by John Kerry. “We are proud to support the work of over 100 organizations at home and abroad,” DiCaprio said. “These grantees are active on the ground, protecting our oceans, forests and endangered species for future generations — and tackling the urgent, existential challenges of climate change.”

The Oscar-winning actor went on to push for urgent action to shift from fossil fuel reliance to renewable energy. “There exist today many proven technologies in renewable energy, clean transportation and sustainable agriculture, that we can begin to build a brighter future for all of us,” he said. “Our challenge is to find new ways to power our lives, employ millions of people and turn every individual into an advocate for clean air and drinkable water. We must demand that politicians accept climate science and make bold commitments before it is too late.”

Said Terry Tamminen, CEO of the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation: “This round of grants comes at a critical time. With a lack of political leadership and continued evidence that climate change is growing worse with record-breaking heatwaves and storms, we believe we need to do as much as we can now, before it is too late.”

The grants announced covered six areas: climate change, wildlife and landscape conservation, marine life and ocean conservation, innovative solutions, indigenous rights and the California program.",http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/leonardo-dicaprio-foundation-unveils-20m-grants-climate-change-wildlife-conservation-1041224,1824
"When a California city gave people a guaranteed income, they worked more — not less","When a California city gave people a guaranteed income, they worked more — not less - Stockton’s experiment shows what $500 per month in “free money” can do for employment, mental health, and more.",1.0,"The city of Stockton, California, embarked on a bold experiment two years ago: It decided to distribute $500 a month to 125 people for 24 months — with no strings attached and no work requirements. The people were randomly chosen from neighborhoods at or below the city’s median household income, and they were free to spend the money any way they liked. Meanwhile, researchers studied what impact the cash had on their lives.

The results from the first year of the experiment, which spanned from February 2019 to February 2020, are now in. And they’re extremely encouraging for its participants, and for advocates who see unconditional cash transfers as an effective way to help people escape poverty.

The most eye-popping finding is that the people who received the cash managed to secure full-time jobs at more than twice the rate of people in a control group, who did not receive cash. Within a year, the proportion of cash recipients who had full-time jobs jumped from 28 percent to 40 percent. The control group saw only a 5 percent jump over the same period.

The researchers wrote in their report that the money gave recipients the stability they needed to set goals, take risks, and find new jobs. One man in his 30s had been eligible for a real estate license for over a year but hadn’t gotten it because he just couldn’t afford to take time off work. Thanks to the freedom offered by the extra $500 per month, he said, his life was “converted 360 degrees … because I have more time and net worth to study … to achieve my goals.”

Critics of cash assistance programs often say that handing out “free money” will make people less inclined to find jobs. But in the research done to date, unconditional cash does not tend to disincentivize work. In several programs — from Alaska and North Carolina in the US, to Finland and Spain in Europe — it has had no effect on employment either way. In some cases, it seems to embolden people with an entrepreneurial bent; for instance, in Japan, initial survey results have shown that recipients are 3.9 times more interested in launching a new business.

Employment aside, there are clear benefits to unconditional cash programs. The Stockton experiment — which was conducted as a randomized controlled trial and underwent an independent evaluation — adds to the growing body of evidence from basic income experiments around the world, which shows that getting unconditional cash tends to boost happiness, health, school attendance, and trust in social institutions, while reducing crime.

More benefits — and some limitations — of Stockton’s guaranteed income trial

There were other benefits from the Stockton program. Cash recipients reported being less anxious and depressed than the control group. On average, the recipients “experienced clinically and statistically significant improvements in their mental health that the control group did not — moving from likely having a mild mental health disorder to likely mental wellness over the year-long intervention,” according to the researchers.

The cash also enabled recipients to help their family and friends. For example, one woman used the cash to help her siblings buy school clothes for their kids and to help her daughter-in-law pay for car insurance. Another bought diapers for her grandchildren.

This isn’t the first time we’ve seen cash programs have positive ripple effects on the broader community. In Kenya, cash transfers have stimulated the economy and benefited not only the recipients themselves but also people in nearby villages.

It’s worth noting a wrinkle in the Stockton trial: Each participant was given $500 per month on a debit card so that researchers would be able to see how they were using the money. However, 40 percent of it was either withdrawn as cash or transferred to an existing bank account, so researchers had to rely on participants to tell them where the money went.

Of the money tracked on the debit cards, recipients spent most on necessities like food (37 percent), home goods and clothes (22 percent), utilities (11 percent), and car costs (10 percent). They spent less than 1 percent on alcohol or cigarettes.

Though these numbers can’t capture the full picture, they offer a counter to harmful stereotypes and faulty assumptions: that people who become poor get that way because they’re bad at rational decision-making and self-control, and that they’ll blow free money on frivolous things or addictive substances. The evidence does not support these beliefs.

The Stockton experiment was a small study with only 125 cash recipients, so the findings should be seen as offering supporting evidence on the effectiveness of cash programs rather than as definitive standalone proof. Nevertheless, the results of this philanthropically funded program — officially known as the Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration (SEED), which received a $1 million grant from the Economic Security Project — help underscore that poverty is a lack of cash, not character, and usefully add to the body of evidence that free money doesn’t disincentivize employment — it can actually boost it.

The implications for policy, during the pandemic and beyond

The message that free money can actually improve job prospects comes at a critical moment, as the Biden administration tries to push through a pandemic aid package that would include direct checks to millions of Americans.

The pandemic has made the idea of direct payments more popular. With the Covid-19 crisis generating so much financial loss and uncertainty, advocates have argued that citizens desperately need some sort of income floor. And against this backdrop, SEED has spawned something much bigger: Mayors for a Guaranteed Income, a coalition of mayors who are pushing for the US to implement a federal guaranteed income. Both SEED and the mayoral coalition are the brainchild of Michael Tubbs, the former mayor of Stockton.

For years now, Tubbs has promoted the idea that a guaranteed income could transform life for Stockton residents, but he’s also made clear this experiment is about a lot more than just his city. “Stockton is a proxy for America: its diversity, its people,” he said. “It’s a place that’s emerging and has big, bold ideas.”

Guaranteed income is a big, bold idea that could improve life for millions of Americans if implemented more widely. That said, it’s not a cure-all for the systemic obstacles that keep people from a healthy, stable life.

As the SEED researchers wrote in their report, “Guaranteed income should not be considered as a singular approach for household stability, but rather as one policy option to be implemented alongside others to shore up market failures.” Other policy options include increasing the supply of affordable housing and raising the minimum wage.

For now, only the first year’s worth of data from the Stockton experiment is available; we have to wait until 2022 for the full results. But the first-year findings signal that guaranteed income programs — combined with better public policy — could go a long way toward fighting poverty.",https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22313272/stockton-basic-income-guaranteed-free-money,7314
